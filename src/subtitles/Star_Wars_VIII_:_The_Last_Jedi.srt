protecting the fleet.

536
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,203
And you were running away.

537
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,367
I'm sorry.

538
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,082
But this fleet is doomed, and if my friend
comes back to it, she's doomed, too.

539
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,527
I've gotta get this...

540
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,889
I gotta get this beacon far away from here.

541
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,405
Then she'll find me and be safe.

542
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,129
You're a selfish traitor.

543
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,290
Look, we can't outrun the First Order fleet.

544
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,766
We can jump to lightspeed!

545
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,921
Well, they can track us through lightspeed.

546
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
They can track us through lightspeed?

547
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Yeah.

548
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,800
They'd just show up thirty seconds later
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel,

549
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,008
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

550
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,410
They can track us through lightspeed.

551
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,721
Yes. And they could...

552
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,241
I can't feel my teeth.

553
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,211
What did you shoot me with?

554
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,361
Active tracking.

555
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,567
What now?

556
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,281
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

557
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,966
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

558
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,690
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

559
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,166
BOTH: ...from the lead ship.

560
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
But we can't get to the tracker.

561
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,920
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

562
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,331
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

563
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,881
BOTH: ...has a dedicated power breaker.

564
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,961
But... Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer?

565
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,129
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

566
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,163
If I can get us there,
I can shut their tracker down.

567
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,648
Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

568
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,122
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

569
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,361
So we blow that one up?

570
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,726
I like where your head's at, but no.

571
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,610
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

573

00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,286

575
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,522
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.
