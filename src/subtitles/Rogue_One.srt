1
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,812
- Mama!
- We know.

2
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:34,123
Jyn, gather your things.
It's time.

3
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,762
- Hello?
- Saw, it's Lyra.

4
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,486
It's happened.
He's come for us.

5
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,245
You know what to do.

6
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:11,846
Jyn, come here.
v
7
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,802
Remember, whatever I do,

8
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,964
I do it to protect you.

9
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:18,805
Say you understand.

10
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:21,284
I understand.

11
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,362
I love you, Stardust.

12
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,004
I love you, too, Papa.

13
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,447
Galen.

14
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,441
Go.

15
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:55,686
Jyn.

16
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:59,802
You know where to go, don't you?

17
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,248
Trust the Force.

18
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,688
You're a hard man to find, Galen.

19
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:44,122
But farming...

20
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,966
Really? Man of your talents?

21
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,564
It's a peaceful life.

22
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,169
It's lonely, I imagine.

23
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:56,892
Since Lyra died, yes.

24
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:58,808
Oh.

25
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,041
Oh...

26
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:10,129
My condolences.

27
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:13,324
Search the house.

28
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,285
What is it you want?

29
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:26,445
The work has stalled.
I need you to come back.

30
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:28,966
I won't do it, Krennic.

31
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:30,612
We were on the
verge of greatness.

32
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:32,365
We were this close

33
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:35,730
to providing peace
and security for the galaxy.

34
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,090
You're confusing peace with terror.

35
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:41,883
Well, you have to start somewhere.

36
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,923
I'd be of no help, Krennic.

37
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,765
My mind just isn't what it was.

38
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:54,525
I have trouble remembering.

39
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:56,962
Even simple things.

40
00:04:58,652 --> 00:04:59,802
Galen...

41
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:03,444
You're an inspired scientist,
but you're a terrible liar.

42
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,241
Now, I admire the effort.

43
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,812
I really do.

44
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:09,762
Oh, look, here's Lyra, back from the dead.

45
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:11,761
It's a miracle.

46
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,002
Stop!

47
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,847
Oh, Lyra,

48
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:22,812
troublesome as ever.

49
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,770
You're not taking him.

50
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,003
No, of course I'm not.
I'm taking you all.

51
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:30,372
You'll all come. You, your child.
You'll all live in comfort.

52
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,327
As hostages.

53
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,923
As heroes of the Empire.

54
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:39,005
Lyra.
Put it down.

55
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,649
Think very carefully.

56
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,805
- You will never win.
- Do it.

57
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:55,846
Lyra!

58
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:57,603
Lyra!

59
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:01,242
They have a child!

60
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,206
Find it!

61
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:35,122
My child!

62
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:37,921
Come.

63
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:41,125
Come.

64
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,651
We have a long ride ahead of us.

65
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:24,012
Check in security,

66
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:26,402
cell block 4227.

67
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,570
4227.

68
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:17,891
TK-62, XX-25900.

69
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,246
I was about to leave.

70
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,766
I came as fast as I could.

71
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:35,844
I have to get back on board.
Walk with me.

72
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:36,889
Back to Jedha?

73
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:38,088
They'll leave without me.

74
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,130
Easy! You have news from Jedha.

75
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,692
Come on.

76
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,966
An Imperial pilot,
one of the cargo drivers

77
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,327
he defected yesterday.

78
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,129
He's telling people
they're making a weapon.

79
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,085
The kyber crystals,
that's what they're for.

80
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,169
What kind of weapon?

81
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:55,841
- Look, I have to go.
- What kind of weapon?

82
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,652
A planet killer! That's what he called it!

83
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,724
A planet killer?

84
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,771
Someone named Erso sent him.
Some old friend of Saw's.

85
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:05,764
Galen Erso? Was it?

86
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,328
I don't know!
They were looking for Saw when we left.

87
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:10,768
- Who else knows about this?
- I have no idea.

88
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:13,204
It's all falling apart.

89
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:14,649
Saw's right.

90
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:17,083
There's spies everywhere.

91
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:18,564
What's all this?

92
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,651
Come on, let's see some scandocs.

93
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:24,532
Yeah, of course.
Just... My gloves.

94
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,765
No!

95
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,685
What have you done?

96
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:34,645
Troopers down.
Section 9.

97
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,007
Are you crazy?

98
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,962
I'll never climb out of here.
My arm!

99
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,242
Get out of the way.

100
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:41,323
Move! Move!

101
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:45,047
Hey. Calm down.
Calm down.

102
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,765
It will be all right.

103
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:35,726
Is that him?

104
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:39,403
He looks kind of different
to how I imagined.

105
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:47,528
Okay.
So you're Saw Gerrera?

106
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:48,648
Saw Gerrera?

107
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:50,522
No?

108
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,046
Okay, we're just wasting time
that we don't have.

109
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,044
I need to speak to Saw Gerrera.
I keep telling them.

110
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,805
Before it's too late.

111
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,522
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.

112
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,365
We need to get to Jedha City.

113
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:06,764
What part of "urgent message"
do you guys not understand?

114
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,252
We are all on the same side.

115
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:12,927
If you just see past
the uniform for a minute.

116
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:55,967
What now?

117
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:59,332
I don't know.
Must be another pickup.

118
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,932
I thought we had everybody.

119
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,243
All clear, sir.

120
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,244
Hallik! Liana Hallik!

121
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,323
Her.

122
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,291
You wanna get out of here?

123
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,407
Hey! What about me?

124
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,043
Give me the keys! Give me the keys!

125
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,810
Congratulations.
You are being rescued.

126
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,485
Please do not resist.

127
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:00,645
LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.

128
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:15,684
You're currently
calling yourself Liana Hallik.

129
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,842
Is that correct?

130
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:20,683
Possession of unsanctioned weapons.

131
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,844
Forgery of Imperial documents.

132
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:24,526
Aggravated assault.
Escape from custody.

133
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,172
Resisting arrest.

134
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:29,284
Imagine if the Imperial
authorities had found out...

135
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,331
who you really were, Jyn Erso.

136
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:36,287
That is your given name, is it not?

137
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,567
Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen Erso?

138
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,803
A known Imperial collaborator
in weapons development.

139
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,006
What is this?

140
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:51,010
It's a chance for you
to make a fresh start.

141
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:52,965
We think you might be able to help us.

142
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,323
This is Captain Cassian Andor,
Rebel Intelligence.

143
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:01,567
When was the last time you were
in contact with your father?

144
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,881
15 years ago.

145
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:08,001
Any idea where he's been all that time?

146
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,362
I like to think he's dead.

147
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:13,932
Makes things easier.

148
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:14,896
Easier than what?

149
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:17,244
That he's been a tool of
the Imperial war machine?

150
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:20,122
I've never had the luxury
of political opinions.

151
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,123
Really?

152
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:24,606
When was your last contact
with Saw Gerrera?

153
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:32,601
It's been a long time.

154
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:35,532
But he'll remember you, though.

155
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:36,602
Wouldn't he?

156
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:39,890
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.

157
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:43,047
We're up against the clock here, girl,
so if there's nothing to talk about,

158
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,532
we'll just put you back
where we found you.

159
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,963
I was a child. Saw Gerrera
saved my life. He raised me.

160
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,122
But I have no idea where he is.

161
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,288
I haven't seen him in years.

162
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,806
We know how to find him.

163
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,121
That's not our problem.

164
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,250
What we need is someone who gets us
through the door without being killed.

165
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,124
You're all rebels, aren't you?

166
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,126
Yes, but Saw Gerrera is an extremist.

167
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,807
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

168
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,563
His militancy has caused the Alliance

169
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:10,769
a great many problems.

170
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,251
We have no choice now but to try

171
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:15,732
and mend that broken trust.

172
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,802
What does this have to do with my father?

173
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:27,490
There's an Imperial defector
in Jedha. A pilot.

174
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,325
He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

175
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:32,405
He's claiming the Emperor
is creating a weapon

176
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:34,689
with the power to destroy entire planets.

177
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,161
The pilot says he was sent by your father.

178
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,527
We need to stop this weapon
before it is finished.

179
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:48,527
Captain Andor's mission is to
authenticate the pilot's story.

180
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,172
And then, if possible, find your father.

181
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:53,607
It appears he is critical to the
development of this super weapon.

182
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:57,644
Given the gravity of the situation
and your history with Saw,

183
00:16:57,812 --> 00:16:59,804
we're hoping that he will
help us locate your father

184
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,612
and return him
to the Senate for testimony.

185
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:13,047
And if I do it?

186
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:16,372
We'll make sure you go free.

187
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:36,882
Captain Andor.

188
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:49,968
I'm K-2SO.

189
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,892
I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.

190
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,405
I remember you.

191
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,928
I see the Council is
sending you with us to Jedha.

192
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,766
Apparently so.

193
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:08,091
That is a bad idea. I think so,
and so does Cassian.

194
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:13,488
What do I know?

195
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,412
My specialty is just strategic analysis.

196
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:20,041
Galen Erso is vital to the
Empire's weapons program.

197
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:21,402
Forget what you heard in there.

198
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,325
There will be no extraction.

199
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:24,642
You find him...

200
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,567
you kill him.

201
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:29,525
Then and there.

202
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:34,964
Shuttle number LMTR-20.

203
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:38,682
Prepare for takeoff while
we check your authorization.

204
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,203
You met K-2?

205
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,442
Charming.

206
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:45,770
He tends to say
whatever comes into his circuits.

207
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:48,083
It's a byproduct of the reprogram.

208
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,767
Why does she get a blaster and I don't?

209
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,804
- What?
- I know how to use it.

210
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,646
That's what I'm afraid of.
Give it to me.

211
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:01,604
We're going to Jedha.

212
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:03,172
That's a war zone.

213
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,801
That's not the point.
Where'd you get it?

214
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:07,408
I found it.

215
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,484
I find that answer
vague and unconvincing.

216
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,644
Trust goes both ways.

217
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,211
You're letting her keep it?

218
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,886
Would you like to know the probability

219
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:29,083
of her using it against you?

220
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:32,892
It's high.

221
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,486
Let's get going.

222
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,052
It's very high.

223
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,202
Lies!

224
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,652
Deceptions!

225
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,848
Let's see it.

226
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:33,168
"Bodhi Rook.
Cargo pilot."

227
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,085
- Local boy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

228
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,484
Okay.
I can hear you.

229
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,405
He didn't capture me.
I came here myself. I defected.

230
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:44,449
I defected.

231
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,962
Every day, more lies.

232
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,927
Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie?

233
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,241
No, we don't have time for this.

234
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,806
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera
before it's too late.

235
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:00,525
Okay.

236
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,606
Sorry, you're...

237
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:06,768
Um...

238
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,923
That's for you.

239
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:12,403
And I gave it to them.

240
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,291
They did not find it!

241
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:16,647
I gave it to them.

242
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,372
Uh, Galen Erso.

243
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:23,803
He told me to find you.

244
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:43,963
Bor Gullet.

245
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:46,324
Uh, Bor Gullet?

246
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:49,364
What? Wait!

247
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:52,530
Galen Erso sent me!

248
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,570
He told me to find you.

249
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:27,292
Most unfortunate about

250
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:29,728
the security breach on Jedha,
Director Krennic.

251
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:33,488
After so many setbacks
and delays, and now this.

252
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:42,209
We've heard word of rumors
circulating through the city.

253
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:44,042
Apparently, you've lost

254
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,368
a rather talkative cargo pilot.

255
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,364
If the Senate gets wind of our project,

256
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,683
countless systems
will flock to the Rebellion.

257
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:53,367
When the battle station is
finished, Governor Tarkin...

258
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,723
the Senate will be of little concern.

259
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:59,486
When has become now, Director Krennic.

260
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:02,212
The Emperor will tolerate
no further delay.

261
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:05,325
You have made time
an ally of the Rebellion.

262
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,687
I suggest we solve
both problems simultaneously...

263
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:12,765
with an immediate test of the weapon.

264
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:17,849
Failure will find you explaining why

265
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:20,931
to a far less patient audience.

266
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:24,122
I will not fail.

267
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,607
What's the matter, Jyn?
You look frightened.

268
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:10,129
I'll always protect you.

269
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:16,932
Stardust.

270
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:18,449
Don't ever change.

271
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:23,687
Trust.

272
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:27,010
Galen.

273
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:41,970
We're coming into orbit.
You have controls.

274
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:56,082
That's Jedha.

275
00:24:58,252 --> 00:24:59,322
Or what's left of it.

276
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:04,327
We find Saw, we find your father.

277
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:50,206
What's with the Destroyer?

278
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:54,051
It's because of
your old friend, Saw Gerrera.

279
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,721
He's been attacking the cargo shipments.

280
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,886
What are they bringing in?

281
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,452
It's what are they taking out.

282
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:07,492
Kyber crystal.
All they can get.

283
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,405
We wondered why
they were stripping the temple.

284
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:10,528
Now we know.

285
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:13,127
It's the fuel for the weapon.

286
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:15,932
The weapon your father's building.

287
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:19,164
Maybe we should leave
target practice behind.

288
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,085
Are you talking about me?

289
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:23,972
She's right.
We need to blend in.

290
00:26:24,052 --> 00:26:25,281
Stay with the ship.

291
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:28,451
I can blend in.
I'm an Imperial droid.

292
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:30,763
The city is under Imperial occupation.

293
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,446
Half the people here wanna reprogram you.

294
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:35,288
The other half wanna
put a hole in your head.

295
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,762
I'm surprised
you're so concerned with my safety.

296
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:38,809
I'm not.

297
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,682
I'm just worried they might
miss you and hit me.

298
00:26:47,932 --> 00:26:50,367
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

299
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:14,532
Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts.

300
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:20,924
No lie is safe.

301
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:30,684
What have you really
brought me, cargo pilot?

302
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:37,010
Bor Gullet will know the truth.

303
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:42,208
The unfortunate side effect
is that one tends...

304
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:44,606
to lose one's mind.

305
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:46,331
No!

306
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:17,366
Hey.

307
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:18,363
You just watch yourself.

308
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:19,488
Wait. No, no.

309
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:20,529
Sorry, sir.

310
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,371
We don't want any trouble.
Sorry.

311
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,489
Come on. Come on.

312
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:26,604
Citizens of Jedha.

313
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,570
You must come forward with information

314
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:31,770
of the location
of this missing cargo pilot.

315
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:35,843
A reward of 600 credits
for the information shall be awarded.

316
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:36,809
I had a contact.

317
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,964
One of Saw's Rebels.

318
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,165
But he's just gone missing.

319
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:43,648
His sister will be looking for him.

320
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:47,291
The temple's been destroyed,
but she'll be there waiting.

321
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:48,488
We'll give her your name

322
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:50,768
and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.

323
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:52,002
Hope?

324
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:55,890
Yeah.
Rebellions are built on hope.

325
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,771
Hands where I can see them.

326
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:58,962
Get over there.

327
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:01,488
Show me some identification.
Check inside.

328
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:05,044
Is this all because of your pilot?

329
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:11,524
May the Force of others be with you.

330
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:14,926
Wait for me.

331
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:17,844
May the Force of others be with you.

332
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:21,602
May the Force of others be with you.

333
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:24,810
Would you trade that necklace
for a glimpse into your future?

334
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:27,929
Yes.

335
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,126
I'm speaking to you.

336
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,968
I'm Chirrut ÃÂÃÂmwe.

337
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:42,971
How did you know I was wearing a necklace?

338
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:45,169
For that answer, you must pay.

339
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:51,328
What do you know about kyber crystals?

340
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:53,012
My father, he...

341
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:56,121
He said they powered
the Jedi's lightsabers.

342
00:29:57,652 --> 00:29:58,847
Jyn.

343
00:29:59,012 --> 00:30:00,241
Come on.
Let's go.

344
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:06,531
The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.

345
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:11,363
Let's go.

346
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,529
We're not here to make friends.

347
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,563
Who are they?

348
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,485
The Guardians of the Whills.

349
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,165
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.

350
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,203
But there's nothing left to protect.

351
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,887
So now they're just
causing trouble for everybody.

352
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:32,604
You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.

353
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:36,652
We have to hurry.
This town is ready to blow.

354
00:30:38,012 --> 00:30:39,685
Citizens of the Empire...

355
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:44,526
Imperial forces tirelessly fight
Saw Gerrera's reign of terror...

356
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:47,332
over the people of this beloved city.

357
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:50,883
Truth and justice
are the tools of the Empire.

358
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:10,448
Tell me you have a backup plan.

359
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:16,844
Incoming!

360
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,723
Looks like we found Saw's rebels.

361
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,609
Up there!

362
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:45,404
Jyn, no!

363
00:31:58,652 --> 00:31:59,563
Hit the terrorist.

364
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:01,323
Get out of there!

365
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,005
Kyber...

366
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,442
Come on!

367
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:05,482
This way!

368
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:08,201
Cassian!

369
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:32,765
Did you know that wasn't me?

370
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:35,211
Yeah.
Of course.

371
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:37,284
I thought I told you to stay on the ship.

372
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:40,287
You did.
But I thought it was boring,

373
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:41,362
and you were in trouble.

374
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:45,685
There were a lot of explosions...

375
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,445
- for two people blending in.
- Freeze!

376
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:51,402
You're right.

377
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,211
I should just wait on the ship.

378
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:07,888
Halt.
Stop right there.

379
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:12,012
Where are you taking these prisoners?

380
00:34:13,572 --> 00:34:15,882
- These are prisoners.
- Yes. Where are you taking them?

381
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:20,683
I am taking them
to imprison them in prison.

382
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,445
- He's taking us to...
- Quiet!

383
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:25,568
And there's a fresh one
if you mouth off again.

384
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,007
- We'll take them from here.
- That's okay.

385
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,323
If you could just point me in the right
direction, I can take them, I'm sure.

386
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:31,451
- I've taken them this far.
- Hey, wait a second.

387
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:32,602
- Take them away.
- Wait.

388
00:34:32,812 --> 00:34:34,166
You can't take them away.

389
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:35,766
You. Stay
here.

390
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:37,127
We need to check your diagnostics.

391
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:38,683
Diagnostics?

392
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:40,684
I'm capable of running my own diagnostics,

393
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:41,762
thank you very much.

394
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,571
Let them pass in peace.

395
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:51,085
Let them pass in peace.

396
00:34:52,972 --> 00:34:54,770
The Force is with me.

397
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:57,288
And I am with the Force.

398
00:34:57,452 --> 00:34:58,602
And I fear nothing.

399
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:01,332
For all is as the Force wills it.

400
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:03,404
Hey, stop right there.

401
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:04,608
He's blind.

402
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:06,172
Is he deaf?

403
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,527
I said stop right there!

404
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,372
Is your foot all right?

405
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:58,492
You almost shot me.

406
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:00,325
You're welcome.

407
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:06,092
Clear of hostiles.

408
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,089
- One hostile.
- He's with us.

409
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:09,963
They're all right.

410
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:18,521
Thanks.

411
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:22,441
Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.

412
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,487
Go back to the ship.
Wait for my call.

413
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:30,403
Is he a Jedi?

414
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:32,529
There are no Jedi here anymore.

415
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,206
Only dreamers like this fool.

416
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,207
The Force did protect me.

417
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:37,802
I protected you.

418
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:39,964
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?

419
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:51,051
Can't you see?
We are no friends of the Empire.

420
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:56,446
Anyone who kills me or my friends

421
00:36:56,532 --> 00:36:58,364
will answer to Saw Gerrera.

422
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,130
Because I'm the daughter of Galen Erso.

423
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:11,086
Are you kidding me? I'm blind.

424
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,289
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

425
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,570
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

426
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:55,362
You pray?

427
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,803
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

428
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:58,928
Really?

429
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:00,572
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

430
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,084
He's praying for the door to open.

431
00:39:04,012 --> 00:39:06,163
It bothers him because
he knows it's possible.

432
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:12,566
Baze Malbus was once the most
devoted Guardian of us all.

433
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:16,529
I'm beginning to think the Force and I
have different priorities.

434
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:18,092
Relax, Captain.

435
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,726
We've been in worse cages than this one.

436
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:21,768
This is the first for me.

437
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,884
There is more than
one sort of prison, Captain.

438
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,368
I sense that you carry yours
wherever you go.

439
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:50,242
Jyn.

440
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,407
Is it really you?

441
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:57,408
I can't believe it!

442
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:00,291
Must be quite a surprise.

443
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:04,568
Are we not still friends?

444
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,562
The last time I saw you,
you gave me a knife and loaded blaster...

445
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,332
and told me to wait
in a bunker till daylight.

446
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,284
I knew you were safe.

447
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,290
You left me behind.

448
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,768
You were already
the best soldier in my cadre.

449
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,810
- I was 16!
- I was protecting you!

450
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:19,928
You dumped me!

451
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:23,164
You were the daughter of
an Imperial science officer.

452
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,408
People were starting to figure that out.

453
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:30,369
People who wanted to use you as a hostage.

454
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,448
Not a day goes by...

455
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:37,207
that I don't think of you.

456
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,051
But today...

457
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:46,604
of all days...

458
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:52,962
It's a trap.

459
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:55,445
Isn't it?

460
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,003
What?

461
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:58,447
The pilot.

462
00:40:58,692 --> 00:40:59,967
The message.

463
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:01,128
All of it.

464
00:41:14,332 --> 00:41:17,803
Did they send you?

465
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,769
Did you come here...

466
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:25,331
to kill me?

467
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:28,844
There's not much of me left.

468
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:31,324
The Alliance wants my father.

469
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:34,322
They think he sent you
a message about a weapon.

470
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,122
I guess they think by sending me,
you might actually help them out.

471
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:44,005
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

472
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:49,168
They wanted an introduction,
they've got it.

473
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:50,601
I'm out now.

474
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:52,604
Rest of you can do what you want.

475
00:41:53,372 --> 00:41:56,365
You care not about the cause?

476
00:41:56,532 --> 00:41:58,205
The cause?

477
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,931
Seriously?

478
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,451
The Alliance...

479
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:05,532
the rebels, whatever it is
you're calling yourself these days...

480
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,888
all it's ever brought me is pain.

481
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:14,769
You can stand to see the Imperial flag
reign across the galaxy?

482
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,722
It's not a problem if you don't look up.

483
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:23,010
I have something to show you.

484
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,282
Come.

485
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:44,489
The Emperor is awaiting my report.

486
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:47,766
One would hope that he and Lord Vader
might've been here for such an occasion.

487
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:50,561
And I thought it prudent to save you
from any potential embarrassment.

488
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:52,928
Your concern's hardly warranted.

489
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,323
If saying it would only make it so.

490
00:42:57,692 --> 00:43:00,332
All Imperial forces have been evacuated...

491
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,610
and I stand ready to destroy
the entire moon.

492
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:04,922
That won't be necessary.

493
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:07,049
We need a statement, not a manifesto.

494
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,812
The Holy City will be enough for today.

495
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:12,046
Target Jedha City.

496
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,124
Prepare single reactor ignition.

497
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:21,449
- Sir, we're in position...
- Fire!

498
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:24,129
Commence primary ignition.

499
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,206
Who's the one in the next cell?

500
00:43:29,972 --> 00:43:31,008
What?

501
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,126
Where?

502
00:43:37,772 --> 00:43:39,729
An Imperial pilot.

503
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:40,922
- Pilot?
- I'm gonna kill him!

504
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:42,003
- No, no. No, wait!
- Come here!

505
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:43,771
No!

506
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:45,645
Back off! Back off!

507
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:49,964
Okay, okay.

508
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:53,531
Are you the pilot?

509
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:59,006
Hey. Hey. Are you the pilot?
The shuttle pilot?

510
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:00,487
Pilot?

511
00:44:00,612 --> 00:44:02,171
What's wrong with him?

512
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:06,331
Galen Erso.

513
00:44:08,132 --> 00:44:09,532
You know that name?

514
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:13,971
I brought the message.
I'm the pilot.

515
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:20,925
I'm the pilot.

516
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:23,326
I'm the pilot.

517
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:25,165
Okay. Good.

518
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:27,725
Now where is Galen Erso?

519
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:32,162
Stand by.

520
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,686
This is the message I was sent.

521
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:47,087
Saw, if you are watching this...

522
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:50,370
then perhaps there's a chance
to save the Alliance.

523
00:44:50,532 --> 00:44:52,649
Perhaps there's a chance
to explain myself...

524
00:44:52,772 --> 00:44:54,889
and, though I don't dare
hope for too much...

525
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:57,521
a chance for Jyn, if she's alive...

526
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:59,649
if you can possibly find her...

527
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:04,563
to let her know that my love
for her has never faded...

528
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:07,209
and how desperately I've missed her.

529
00:45:10,972 --> 00:45:13,123
Jyn, my Stardust...

530
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,127
I can't imagine what you think of me.

531
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:21,042
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.

532
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,005
I was told that soon enough

533
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:24,845
Krennic would have you as well.

534
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,122
As time went by...

535
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:28,249
I knew that you were either dead...

536
00:45:28,412 --> 00:45:30,722
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

537
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:34,251
I knew if I had refused to work,
if I took my own life...

538
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:36,563
it would only be a matter of time
before Krennic realized...

539
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:39,088
he no longer needed me
to complete the project.

540
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:41,687
So I did the one thing nobody expected.

541
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:42,848
I lied.

542
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,410
I learned to lie.

543
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:47,723
I played the part of a beaten man

544
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,644
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

545
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:51,605
I made myself indispensable...

546
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:55,851
and all the while, I laid
the groundwork of my revenge.

547
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:58,409
We call it the Death Star.

548
00:45:58,572 --> 00:45:59,972
There is no better name...

549
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:03,563
and the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

550
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:06,486
I've placed a weakness
deep within the system...

551
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:09,207
a flaw so small and powerful,
they will never find it.

552
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,442
But, Jyn...

553
00:46:10,972 --> 00:46:13,328
Jyn, if you're listening, my beloved...

554
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:17,212
so much of my life has been wasted.

555
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:21,249
I try to think of you only
in the moments when I'm strong...

556
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:24,086
because the pain of
not having you with me...

557
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:27,211
your mother, our family.

558
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:29,409
The pain of that loss
is so overwhelming...

559
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:31,604
I risk failing even now.

560
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:34,207
It's just so hard not to think of you.

561
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:37,970
Think of where you are...

562
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:40,931
my Stardust.

563
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,322
Saw...

564
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:45,643
the reactor module, that's the key.

565
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:47,644
That's the place I've laid my trap.

566
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:50,043
It's well hidden and unstable.

567
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:53,292
One blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.

568
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,326
You'll need the plans...

569
00:46:56,492 --> 00:46:59,212
the structural plans for the Death Star,
to find the reactor.

570
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:01,844
I know there's a complete
engineering archive...

571
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:05,084
in the data vault
at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.

572
00:47:05,172 --> 00:47:07,687
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module...

573
00:47:07,852 --> 00:47:11,402
will set off a chain reaction
that will destroy the entire station.

574
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:39,648
Go, go!

575
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:44,965
K-2, K-2!
Where are you?

576
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,488
There you are.

577
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:48,604
I'm standing by as you requested...

578
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,968
although there's a problem on the horizon.

579
00:47:51,692 --> 00:47:54,127
There's no horizon.

580
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,966
Locate our position.
Bring that ship in here, now!

581
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:58,361
Where are you going?

582
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:00,012
I gotta find Jyn.

583
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:01,768
Get the pilot, we need him!

584
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:03,207
All right.

585
00:48:03,412 --> 00:48:04,892
I'll get the pilot.

586
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,568
Pilot.

587
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:15,969
No, no, no!

588
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:20,241
Let's go.

589
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:21,402
Jyn!

590
00:48:22,212 --> 00:48:23,202
Jyn!

591
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:28,602
Hey.

592
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:30,888
We gotta go.

593
00:48:31,932 --> 00:48:32,968
I know where your father is.

594
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:36,125
Go with him, Jyn.

595
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:37,282
You must go!

596
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:39,323
Come with us.

597
00:48:39,532 --> 00:48:41,205
I will run no longer.

598
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:43,565
- Come on.
- But you must save yourself.

599
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:45,248
- Come on.
- Go!

600
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:46,442
There's no time!

601
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,845
Save the Rebellion!

602
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,405
Save the dream.

603
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:14,644
Oh, it's beautiful.

604
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:25,328
Chirrut, let's go!

605
00:49:27,452 --> 00:49:28,488
Come on!

606
00:49:28,652 --> 00:49:30,405
Let's get out of here!

607
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:47,082
Get us out of here!

608
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:48,322
Punch it!

609
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:53,167
I'm not very optimistic about our odds.

610
00:49:53,332 --> 00:49:54,322
Not now, K.

611
00:50:40,452 --> 00:50:41,329
Come on!

612
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:47,202
Punch it.

613
00:50:47,372 --> 00:50:48,408
I haven't completed my calculations.

614
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:50,643
I'll make them for you.

615
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:21,850
I believe I owe you
an apology, Director Krennic.

616
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:25,005
Your work exceeds all expectations.

617
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:29,964
And you'll tell the Emperor as much?

618
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,249
I will tell him that his patience
with your misadventures...

619
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:36,327
has been rewarded with a weapon that
will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.

620
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:38,529
And that that was only an inkling

621
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:40,331
of its destructive potential.

622
00:51:40,492 --> 00:51:42,927
I will tell him that I will be
taking control over the weapon...

623
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:46,648
I first spoke of years ago
effective immediately.

624
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:53,845
We stand here amidst my achievement.

625
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:55,532
Not yours!

626
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:57,405
I'm afraid the recent security breaches...

627
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:01,005
have laid bare your inadequacies
as a military director.

628
00:52:01,212 --> 00:52:03,329
The breaches have been filled.

629
00:52:03,532 --> 00:52:06,127
Jedha has been silenced.

630
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:07,965
You think this pilot acted alone?

631
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:11,603
He was dispatched from
the installation on Eadu...

632
00:52:12,532 --> 00:52:14,888
Galen Erso's facility.

633
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:20,051
Oh, we'll see about this.

634
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:26,371
A coded message from Captain Andor, sir.

635
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:28,608
"Weapon confirmed."

636
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:30,606
"Jedha destroyed."

637
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,448
"Mission target located
on Eadu, please advise."

638
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:35,443
Destroyed?

639
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:42,602
Proceed.

640
00:52:43,652 --> 00:52:46,167
Tell him my orders still stand.

641
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:48,324
Tell him to proceed with haste...

642
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,932
and keep to the plan.

643
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:52,562
We have no idea
what he's building for the Empire.

644
00:52:52,692 --> 00:52:56,083
We have to kill Galen Erso
while we have the chance.

645
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,483
Baze, tell me.

646
00:53:10,372 --> 00:53:11,647
All of it?

647
00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:14,125
The whole city?

648
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:17,928
Tell me.

649
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:19,208
All of it.

650
00:53:26,892 --> 00:53:28,042
Understood.

651
00:53:36,452 --> 00:53:37,886
Set course for Eadu.

652
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:39,406
Setting course for Eadu.

653
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:41,450
Is that where my father is?

654
00:53:42,492 --> 00:53:43,608
I think so.

655
00:53:43,772 --> 00:53:45,764
So you're Galen's daughter?

656
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:47,249
You know him?

657
00:53:47,412 --> 00:53:50,086
I am Bodhi, the pilot.

658
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:51,402
You brought the message.

659
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:52,528
Yes.

660
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:53,887
Your father...

661
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:56,732
he said I could get right by myself.

662
00:53:57,332 --> 00:53:58,925
He said I could make it right...

663
00:53:59,092 --> 00:54:00,970
if I was brave enough...

664
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:03,565
to listen to what was in my heart.

665
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,404
Do something about it.

666
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,488
Guess it was too late.

667
00:54:12,052 --> 00:54:13,406
It wasn't too late.

668
00:54:13,612 --> 00:54:15,888
Seems pretty late to me.

669
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,486
No.

670
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:20,407
We can beat the people who did this.

671
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:23,407
My father's message, I've seen it.

672
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:26,645
They call it the Death Star.

673
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:28,287
But they have no idea...

674
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:30,125
there's a way to defeat it.

675
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:31,521
You're wrong about my father.

676
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:33,729
He did build it.

677
00:54:33,932 --> 00:54:35,764
Because he knew they'd do it without him.

678
00:54:36,412 --> 00:54:37,892
My father made a choice.

679
00:54:38,052 --> 00:54:40,408
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.

680
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:41,972
He's rigged a trap inside it.

681
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:44,448
That's why he sent you,
to bring that message.

682
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:45,563
Where is it?

683
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:47,692
Where's the message?

684
00:54:50,972 --> 00:54:52,122
It was a hologram.

685
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:55,648
You have that message, right?

686
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,967
Everything happened so fast.

687
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:05,808
Did you see it?

688
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,962
You don't believe me?

689
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:14,321
I'm not the one you've got to convince.

690
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:15,642
I believe her.

691
00:55:17,332 --> 00:55:18,686
That's good to know.

692
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:20,048
What kind of trap?

693
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:22,846
You said your father made a trap.

694
00:55:23,012 --> 00:55:25,129
The reactor.
He's placed a weakness there.

695
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,203
He's been hiding it for years.

696
00:55:26,412 --> 00:55:30,325
He said if you can blow the reactor,
the module, the whole system goes down.

697
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:33,005
You need to send word to the Alliance.

698
00:55:33,132 --> 00:55:33,929
I've done that.

699
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:36,044
They have to know
there's a way to destroy this thing.

700
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:38,010
They have to go to Scarif
to get the plans.

701
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,765
I can't risk sending that.

702
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,764
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.

703
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,726
Then we'll find him and bring him back.

704
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:48,086
And he can tell them himself.

705
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:08,203
Course set for Eadu, sir.

706
00:56:26,772 --> 00:56:29,241
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

707
00:56:29,332 --> 00:56:30,322
20 degrees to the right.

708
00:56:32,212 --> 00:56:33,566
10 degrees up.

709
00:56:33,732 --> 00:56:34,882
Lower, lower, lower.
Lower!

710
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:36,762
Are you sure this is the way?

711
00:56:36,972 --> 00:56:38,122
They have landing trackers here.

712
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:39,322
They have patrol squadrons.

713
00:56:39,452 --> 00:56:40,727
You've got to stay
in the canyon. Keep it low.

714
00:56:45,932 --> 00:56:46,729
Watch your right!

715
00:56:51,132 --> 00:56:53,010
There's a 26% chance of failure.

716
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:54,083
How much farther?

717
00:56:54,252 --> 00:56:56,130
I don't know, I'm not sure.
I never really come this way.

718
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:58,443
But we're close, we're close.
I know that.

719
00:56:58,652 --> 00:56:59,881
Now, there's a 35% chance of failure.

720
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:01,088
I don't wanna know.
Thank you!

721
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:02,208
I understand.

722
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:04,921
Now! Put it down, now!

723
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,208
The wind.

724
00:57:06,452 --> 00:57:08,045
If you keep going,
you'll be right over the shuttle depot.

725
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:09,922
- Watch out!
- K!

726
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,362
Hold on tight!

727
00:57:14,492 --> 00:57:15,892
We're coming down hard!

728
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:29,169
Try them again.

729
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,290
I am, sir.
We...

730
00:57:31,892 --> 00:57:33,042
The signal's gone dead.

731
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,886
Squadron up.

732
00:57:37,492 --> 00:57:38,892
Target Eadu.

733
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:50,132
How about now? Check stabilizers.

734
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,052
Bodhi, where's the lab?

735
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:57,168
The research facility?

736
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:58,288
Yeah.
Where is it?

737
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:00,085
It's just over that ridge.

738
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:02,488
That's a shuttle depot
straight ahead of us.

739
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,331
- You are sure of that?
- Yes.

740
00:58:04,492 --> 00:58:07,405
We'll have to hope there's still
an Imperial ship left to steal.

741
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:09,492
Here's what we're doing.

742
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,531
Hopefully the storm keeps up
and keeps us hidden down here.

743
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:14,570
Bodhi, you're coming with me.

744
00:58:14,772 --> 00:58:16,206
We'll go up the ridge and check it out.

745
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:17,562
I'm coming with you.

746
00:58:17,772 --> 00:58:19,365
No, your father's message.

747
00:58:19,492 --> 00:58:21,688
We can't risk it.
You're the messenger.

748
00:58:21,852 --> 00:58:23,332
That's ridiculous, we all got the message.

749
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:24,562
Everyone here knows it.

750
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:28,965
"One blast to the reactor module
and the whole system goes down."

751
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:31,772
That's how you said it,
"The whole system goes down."

752
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:33,924
Get to work fixing our comms.

753
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:37,889
All I want to do right now
is get a handle on what we're up against.

754
00:58:38,132 --> 00:58:40,886
So we're gonna go very small
and very careful up the rise...

755
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:41,923
and see what's what.

756
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,047
Let's get outta here.

757
00:58:58,052 --> 00:58:59,850
Does he look like a killer?

758
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:01,964
No. He has the
face of a friend.

759
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:03,892
Who are you talking about?

760
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:06,490
Captain Andor.

761
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:07,688
Why'd you ask that?

762
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:09,127
What do you mean,
"Does he look like a killer?"

763
00:59:09,732 --> 00:59:11,212
The Force moves darkly

764
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:13,204
near a creature that's about to kill.

765
00:59:15,572 --> 00:59:17,404
His weapon was
in the sniper configuration.

766
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,048
No, no, no.
We've got to go up.

767
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:27,726
You can't see much from down there.

768
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:02,682
This way.

769
01:00:03,612 --> 01:00:05,490
I'll be right behind you.

770
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,487
Come on.

771
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:25,885
Where are you going?

772
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:27,964
I'm gonna follow Jyn.

773
01:00:28,132 --> 01:00:30,044
Her path is clear.

774
01:00:30,212 --> 01:00:31,805
Alone?

775
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:33,287
Good luck!

776
01:00:33,492 --> 01:00:36,485
I don't need luck.
I have you!

777
01:00:45,532 --> 01:00:47,091
What are they doing?

778
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:50,167
If Cassian comes back,
we're leaving without them.

779
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,685
You see Erso out there?

780
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:19,611
We've come too far.

781
01:01:22,732 --> 01:01:24,610
Patience, my friend.

782
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:35,968
That's him.

783
01:01:36,132 --> 01:01:38,806
That's him.
Galen, in the dark suit.

784
01:01:54,612 --> 01:01:57,286
Get back down there
and find us a ride outta here.

785
01:01:57,492 --> 01:01:59,563
- Well, what are you doing?
- You heard me.

786
01:01:59,732 --> 01:02:01,291
You said we came up here
just to have a look.

787
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:03,603
I'm here, I'm looking.
Go.

788
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:05,962
Hurry!

789
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,251
Excellent news, Galen.

790
01:02:18,412 --> 01:02:20,972
The battle station is complete.

791
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:22,926
You must be very proud.

792
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:25,445
Proud as I can be, Krennic.

793
01:02:25,692 --> 01:02:28,685
Gather your engineers.
I have an announcement.

794
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:46,087
Is that all of them?

795
01:02:46,332 --> 01:02:47,607
Yes.

796
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:55,162
Gentlemen, one of you...

797
01:02:55,732 --> 01:02:57,530
betrayed the Empire.

798
01:02:59,132 --> 01:03:02,250
One of you has conspired with a pilot...

799
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:05,371
to send messages to the Rebellion.

800
01:03:06,172 --> 01:03:08,448
And I urge that traitor...

801
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:09,927
step forward.

802
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:24,803
Very well...

803
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:26,929
I'll consider it a group effort then.

804
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:28,323
Ready!

805
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:29,926
- No! No!
- Aim!

806
01:03:31,772 --> 01:03:32,888
And fire!

807
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:34,526
Stop! Stop! Stop!

808
01:03:34,692 --> 01:03:35,603
Krennic, stop!

809
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:39,049
It was me!

810
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:50,846
They have nothing to do with it.

811
01:03:51,012 --> 01:03:52,366
Spare them.

812
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:18,329
Fire!

813
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:33,201
How do I know the weapon is complete?

814
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:36,888
Let me share with you some details.

815
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:52,009
Cassian.

816
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:54,292
Cassian, can you hear me?

817
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:55,812
I'm here.
You've got it working?

818
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:57,725
Affirmative, yes.
Although we have a problem.

819
01:04:57,892 --> 01:05:00,407
There's an Alliance squadron
approaching. Clear the area.

820
01:05:00,612 --> 01:05:02,763
No, no, no, no! Tell them to hold off!

821
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:04,406
Jyn's on that platform.

822
01:05:07,372 --> 01:05:08,362
Jedha...

823
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:12,611
Saw Gerrera.
His band of fanatics...

824
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:14,326
their Holy City...

825
01:05:14,492 --> 01:05:18,168
the last reminder of the Jedi, gone.

826
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:20,846
You'll never win.

827
01:05:21,412 --> 01:05:24,211
Now where have I heard that before?

828
01:05:25,652 --> 01:05:27,086
Relay from Captain Andor.

829
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:28,489
General.

830
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:31,161
Captain Andor requesting
a delay on squadron support.

831
01:05:31,372 --> 01:05:33,887
Alliance forces on site.
Please confirm.

832
01:05:34,052 --> 01:05:35,771
Get the squadron leader on.
Get him on now!

833
01:05:35,972 --> 01:05:37,201
They're already engaged, sir.

834
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:03,609
Jyn. No.

835
01:06:04,652 --> 01:06:07,884
Return fire! To your stations!

836
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:10,123
Get our fighters in the air now!

837
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,408
Father!

838
01:06:36,332 --> 01:06:38,608
Roger that.
3 through 7.

839
01:06:53,692 --> 01:06:55,843
Fall back! Fall back!

840
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,005
Director, we need to evacuate.

841
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,528
Papa.
Papa, it's me.

842
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,321
It's Jyn.

843
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:18,128
Jyn?

844
01:08:20,372 --> 01:08:21,601
Stardust.

845
01:08:22,492 --> 01:08:23,642
Papa.

846
01:08:25,012 --> 01:08:26,605
I've seen your message.

847
01:08:26,772 --> 01:08:28,729
The hologram, I've seen it.

848
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,809
It must be destroyed.

849
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:34,004
I know. I know.

850
01:08:34,852 --> 01:08:35,842
We will.

851
01:08:37,052 --> 01:08:38,281
Jyn.

852
01:08:41,012 --> 01:08:42,002
Look at you.

853
01:08:45,452 --> 01:08:47,728
I have so much to tell you.

854
01:08:58,492 --> 01:08:59,482
Papa.

855
01:09:00,492 --> 01:09:01,448
No.

856
01:09:01,612 --> 01:09:03,649
No! Papa.

857
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,286
Papa, come on!

858
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,087
Over there! Take 'em down.

859
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:11,448
Come on. Papa.
Come on.

860
01:09:13,772 --> 01:09:14,762
Jyn, we gotta go.
Come on.

861
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:16,332
I can't leave him.

862
01:09:16,492 --> 01:09:18,643
Listen to me, he's gone.

863
01:09:18,892 --> 01:09:20,565
Nothing you can do.
Come on.

864
01:09:20,732 --> 01:09:22,086
- I can't leave him.
- Come on!

865
01:09:22,212 --> 01:09:23,407
I can't.

866
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:24,648
Move!

867
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:32,846
- This way, this way!
- Down!

868
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:39,207
Come on! Come on!

869
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:56,689
Well done.

870
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:59,043
You're a rebel now.

871
01:10:06,052 --> 01:10:06,929
Let's go! Let's go!

872
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:08,486
Come on, let's move!

873
01:10:08,692 --> 01:10:10,570
Come on, let's get out of here!

874
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:12,132
Move, move, move!

875
01:10:12,772 --> 01:10:15,207
Okay, K-2.
Let's go!

876
01:10:15,372 --> 01:10:16,522
Copy that.

877
01:10:34,412 --> 01:10:36,563
Ion thrusters low until
we've cleared the storm.

878
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,961
Understood.

879
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:57,612
You lied to me.

880
01:10:58,612 --> 01:10:59,966
You're in shock.

881
01:11:00,932 --> 01:11:02,764
You went up there to kill my father.

882
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:06,448
You don't know what you're talking about.

883
01:11:06,612 --> 01:11:07,966
Deny it.

884
01:11:08,452 --> 01:11:11,923
You're in shock and looking
for some place to put it.

885
01:11:12,132 --> 01:11:13,282
I've seen it before.

886
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:14,602
I bet you have.

887
01:11:14,732 --> 01:11:15,609
They know.

888
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:18,966
You lied about why we came here
and you lied about why you went up alone.

889
01:11:20,772 --> 01:11:23,003
I had every chance to pull the trigger...

890
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,805
but did I?

891
01:11:27,852 --> 01:11:28,490
Did I?

892
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:30,442
You might as well have.

893
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:32,806
My father was living proof...

894
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:34,247
and you put him at risk.

895
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:36,768
Those were Alliance bombs that killed him.

896
01:11:36,972 --> 01:11:38,452
I had orders...

897
01:11:38,612 --> 01:11:40,763
orders that I disobeyed.

898
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:42,452
But you wouldn't understand that.

899
01:11:42,612 --> 01:11:43,682
Orders?

900
01:11:43,812 --> 01:11:45,804
When you know they're wrong?

901
01:11:47,612 --> 01:11:49,808
You might as well be a Stormtrooper.

902
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,292
What do you know?

903
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,690
We don't all have
the luxury of deciding...

904
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:56,168
when and where we want to
care about something.

905
01:11:56,732 --> 01:11:58,928
Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you.

906
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:01,250
Some of us live it.

907
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:05,250
I've been in this fight
since I was 6 years old.

908
01:12:07,852 --> 01:12:10,811
You're not the only one
who lost everything.

909
01:12:12,012 --> 01:12:15,722
Some of us just decided
to do something about it.

910
01:12:18,332 --> 01:12:20,688
You can't talk your way around this.

911
01:12:24,452 --> 01:12:25,932
I don't have to.

912
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,292
Yavin 4.

913
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:35,209
Make sure they know
we're coming in with a stolen ship.

914
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,126
Anybody else?

915
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:40,610
My lord, Director Krennic...

916
01:13:40,772 --> 01:13:42,764
has arrived.

917
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:44,401
Director Krennic.

918
01:14:45,972 --> 01:14:47,645
Lord Vader.

919
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:50,883
You seem unsettled.

920
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:52,247
No...

921
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:53,528
just pressed for time.

922
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:56,002
There's a great many things to attend to.

923
01:14:56,172 --> 01:14:57,572
My apologies.

924
01:14:57,772 --> 01:15:01,049
You do have
a great many things to explain.

925
01:15:01,212 --> 01:15:03,602
I delivered the weapon
the Emperor requested.

926
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,564
I deserve an audience...

927
01:15:05,692 --> 01:15:09,686
to make certain that
he understands its remarkable...

928
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,122
potential.

929
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:16,485
Its power to create problems
has certainly been confirmed.

930
01:15:16,652 --> 01:15:18,564
A city destroyed...

931
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:21,691
an Imperial facility openly attacked.

932
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:25,126
It was Governor Tarkin
that suggested the test.

933
01:15:26,292 --> 01:15:29,968
You were not summoned here
to grovel, Director Krennic.

934
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,082
No...

935
01:15:31,172 --> 01:15:33,164
There is no Death Star.

936
01:15:33,332 --> 01:15:34,527
The Senate has been informed...

937
01:15:34,772 --> 01:15:38,004
that Jedha was destroyed
in a mining disaster.

938
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:39,208
Yes, my lord.

939
01:15:39,372 --> 01:15:42,843
I expect you not to rest until
you can assure the Emperor...

940
01:15:43,132 --> 01:15:45,442
that Galen Erso has not compromised

941
01:15:45,572 --> 01:15:47,848
this weapon in any way.

942
01:15:51,772 --> 01:15:54,207
So I'm still in command?

943
01:15:57,172 --> 01:15:59,289
You'll speak to the Emperor about...

944
01:16:12,412 --> 01:16:17,771
Be careful not to choke
on your aspirations, Director.

945
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:31,049
We must scatter the fleet.

946
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:34,526
We have no recourse but to surrender.

947
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:37,288
Are we really talking
about disbanding something...

948
01:16:37,452 --> 01:16:39,444
that we've worked so hard to create?

949
01:16:39,652 --> 01:16:41,211
We can't just give in!

950
01:16:41,452 --> 01:16:43,284
We joined an alliance, not a suicide pact.

951
01:16:43,452 --> 01:16:44,772
We've only now managed
to gather our forces.

952
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:46,931
Gather our forces?

953
01:16:47,132 --> 01:16:49,283
General Draven's already
blown up an Imperial base.

954
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:50,772
A decision needed to be made!

955
01:16:51,132 --> 01:16:52,486
If it's war you want...

956
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,046
you'll fight alone.

957
01:16:54,212 --> 01:16:56,044
If that's how it's going,
why have an alliance at all?

958
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:59,250
If she's telling the truth,
we need to act now!

959
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:00,766
Councilors, please.

960
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:01,922
It is simple.

961
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:04,521
The Empire has the means
of mass destruction...

962
01:17:04,732 --> 01:17:05,802
the Rebellion does not.

963
01:17:06,052 --> 01:17:07,771
A Death Star.
This is nonsense.

964
01:17:07,972 --> 01:17:09,486
What reason would my father have to lie?

965
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:11,331
What benefit would it bring him?

966
01:17:11,572 --> 01:17:13,325
To lure our forces into a final battle

967
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:14,806
to destroy us once and for all.

968
01:17:15,572 --> 01:17:17,768
Risk everything? Based on what?

969
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:19,127
The testimony of a criminal?

970
01:17:19,372 --> 01:17:22,444
The dying words of her father,
an Imperial scientist?

971
01:17:22,612 --> 01:17:24,410
But don't forget the Imperial pilot.

972
01:17:25,012 --> 01:17:27,129
My father gave his life so that
we may have a chance to defeat this.

973
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:28,688
So you've told us.

974
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:31,128
If the Empire has this kind of power,

975
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:32,487
what chance do we have?

976
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:35,010
What chance do we have?

977
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:37,651
The question is "what choice."

978
01:17:38,372 --> 01:17:39,488
Run, hide...

979
01:17:39,652 --> 01:17:42,042
plead for mercy, scatter your forces.

980
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:45,006
You give way to an enemy this evil
with this much power...

981
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:48,085
and you condemn the galaxy
to an eternity of submission.

982
01:17:48,252 --> 01:17:50,050
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.

983
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:51,328
Every moment you waste

984
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:53,529
is another step closer
to the ashes of Jedha.

985
01:17:54,692 --> 01:17:57,762
- What is she proposing?
- Just let the girl speak.

986
01:17:58,012 --> 01:17:59,685
Send your best troops to Scarif.

987
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:04,692
Send the rebel fleet if you have to.

988
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:07,125
You need to capture the Death Star plans

989
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:08,692
if there's any hope of destroying it.

990
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:15,848
You're asking us to invade
an Imperial installation...

991
01:18:16,052 --> 01:18:17,930
based on nothing but hope.

992
01:18:20,052 --> 01:18:22,408
Rebellions are built on hope.

993
01:18:24,572 --> 01:18:26,052
There is no hope.

994
01:18:26,212 --> 01:18:27,851
I say we fight.

995
01:18:27,972 --> 01:18:30,646
I say the Rebellion is finished!

996
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,606
I'm sorry, Jyn.

997
01:18:38,492 --> 01:18:40,768
Without the full support of the Council...

998
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:44,645
the odds are too great.

999
01:19:04,452 --> 01:19:05,932
General Syndulla,

1000
01:19:06,012 --> 01:19:07,924
please report to the briefing room.

1001
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:10,648
You don't look happy.

1002
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:12,481
They prefer to surrender.

1003
01:19:12,692 --> 01:19:13,523
And you?

1004
01:19:14,012 --> 01:19:15,002
She wants to fight.

1005
01:19:15,172 --> 01:19:17,243
So do I.
We all do.

1006
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,489
The Force is strong.

1007
01:19:20,092 --> 01:19:22,243
I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.

1008
01:19:22,452 --> 01:19:23,772
How many do we need?

1009
01:19:23,932 --> 01:19:25,252
What are you talking about?

1010
01:19:33,092 --> 01:19:35,448
They were never gonna believe you.

1011
01:19:35,612 --> 01:19:37,171
I appreciate the support.

1012
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:38,967
But I do.

1013
01:19:41,492 --> 01:19:42,972
I believe you.

1014
01:19:48,132 --> 01:19:49,248
We'd like to volunteer.

1015
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:53,805
Some of us...

1016
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:55,725
Well, most of us...

1017
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:59,569
we've all done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.

1018
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:01,812
Spies...

1019
01:20:02,492 --> 01:20:05,371
saboteurs, assassins.

1020
01:20:06,732 --> 01:20:09,964
Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion.

1021
01:20:11,532 --> 01:20:12,807
And every time I walked away...

1022
01:20:12,972 --> 01:20:15,362
from something I wanted to forget...

1023
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:20,168
I told myself it was
for a cause that I believed in.

1024
01:20:21,332 --> 01:20:22,766
A cause that was worth it.

1025
01:20:24,372 --> 01:20:26,489
Without that, we're lost.

1026
01:20:27,652 --> 01:20:30,326
Everything we've done
would have been for nothing.

1027
01:20:33,732 --> 01:20:36,201
I couldn't face myself if I gave up now.

1028
01:20:39,852 --> 01:20:41,332
None of us could.

1029
01:20:46,412 --> 01:20:47,766
It won't be comfortable.

1030
01:20:48,372 --> 01:20:50,807
It'd be a bit cramped, but we'd all fit.

1031
01:20:53,172 --> 01:20:54,572
We could go.

1032
01:20:56,532 --> 01:20:58,364
Okay.
Gear up.

1033
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:00,810
Grab anything that's not nailed down.

1034
01:21:02,812 --> 01:21:03,768
Go, go, go!

1035
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:04,962
Jyn.

1036
01:21:05,892 --> 01:21:07,963
I'll be there for you.

1037
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:11,849
Cassian said I had to.

1038
01:21:17,732 --> 01:21:21,089
I'm not used to people sticking around
when things go bad.

1039
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:23,252
Welcome home.

1040
01:21:47,692 --> 01:21:49,251
May the Force be with us.

1041
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,125
Cargo shuttle, read back please.

1042
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,282
What's going on out there?

1043
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:01,408
That ship's off-limits.

1044
01:22:01,652 --> 01:22:04,372
No one's supposed to be on board
until further instructions.

1045
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:06,932
Yes, yes, we are.

1046
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:08,208
Affirmative.

1047
01:22:08,412 --> 01:22:09,812
That's an impounded Imperial ship.

1048
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:12,168
What's your call sign, pilot?

1049
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:14,449
- Um...
- We have to go.

1050
01:22:14,932 --> 01:22:15,968
It's, um...

1051
01:22:16,972 --> 01:22:18,292
Say something.

1052
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:19,649
Come on.

1053
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:21,363
Rogue.

1054
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:25,167
Rogue One.

1055
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:26,567
Rogue One?

1056
01:22:26,732 --> 01:22:29,167
There is no Rogue One!

1057
01:22:29,332 --> 01:22:30,607
Well, there is now.

1058
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:33,409
Rogue One, pulling away.

1059
01:22:33,572 --> 01:22:35,086
Pulling away.

1060
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:52,487
Despite what the others say,
war is inevitable.

1061
01:22:52,652 --> 01:22:53,642
Yes, I agree.

1062
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:55,963
I must return to Alderaan
to inform my people

1063
01:22:56,092 --> 01:22:57,970
that there will be no peace.

1064
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:00,804
We will need every advantage.

1065
01:23:01,892 --> 01:23:03,326
Your friend...

1066
01:23:04,332 --> 01:23:05,766
the Jedi.

1067
01:23:07,452 --> 01:23:09,489
He served me well during the Clone Wars...

1068
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:12,087
and has lived in hiding
since the Emperor's purge.

1069
01:23:12,252 --> 01:23:13,652
Yes, I will send for him.

1070
01:23:13,852 --> 01:23:16,083
You will need someone you can trust.

1071
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:20,049
I would trust her with my life.

1072
01:23:20,652 --> 01:23:21,847
- Captain Antilles.
- Senator.

1073
01:23:22,012 --> 01:23:24,004
I have a mission for you, sir.

1074
01:23:34,012 --> 01:23:36,607
Okay.
We're coming in.

1075
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:38,612
There's a planet-wide
defensive shield...

1076
01:23:38,812 --> 01:23:40,371
with a single main entry gate.

1077
01:23:40,692 --> 01:23:42,126
This shuttle should be equipped with

1078
01:23:42,212 --> 01:23:44,363
an access code that allows us through.

1079
01:23:44,692 --> 01:23:46,843
Assuming the Empire hasn't
logged it as overdue.

1080
01:23:47,612 --> 01:23:49,251
And if they have?

1081
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:51,682
Then they shut the gate.

1082
01:23:51,892 --> 01:23:53,212
And we're all annihilated

1083
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:55,523
in the cold, dark vacuum of space.

1084
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:57,886
Not me.

1085
01:23:59,332 --> 01:24:01,801
I can survive in space.

1086
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:13,567
Okay.

1087
01:24:13,732 --> 01:24:14,882
Here goes.

1088
01:24:19,332 --> 01:24:22,882
Cargo shuttle SW-0608
requesting a landing pad.

1089
01:24:25,652 --> 01:24:28,008
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,

1090
01:24:28,092 --> 01:24:29,970
you're not listed on the arrival schedule.

1091
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:32,169
Acknowledged, Gate Control.

1092
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:35,046
We were rerouted from Eadu flight station.

1093
01:24:35,212 --> 01:24:36,487
Transmitting clearance code now.

1094
01:24:36,692 --> 01:24:38,012
Transmitting.

1095
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:53,248
Cargo shuttle, SW-0608...

1096
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:57,765
- you are cleared for entry.
- Yes!

1097
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,327
Impressive.

1098
01:25:04,612 --> 01:25:06,285
I'll tell the others.

1099
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,122
Okay.

1100
01:25:13,412 --> 01:25:15,927
Tractor beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1101
01:25:16,092 --> 01:25:19,290
Tractor beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1102
01:25:27,012 --> 01:25:30,801
SW-0608,
cleared for Landing Pad 9.

1103
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,764
Acknowledge, please.

1104
01:25:32,972 --> 01:25:36,602
SW-0608 proceeding to
LP 9 as instructed.

1105
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,846
Main building down there, what is it?

1106
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,526
That's the Citadel Tower.

1107
01:25:40,692 --> 01:25:43,446
They keep all the Imperial
structural archives up there.

1108
01:25:43,652 --> 01:25:45,848
If the plans are anywhere,
they'll be there.

1109
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:48,771
And the dish at the top, what's it for?

1110
01:25:49,492 --> 01:25:52,212
I guess it takes a lot of signal
to send those data files out.

1111
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:56,852
Landing track, engaged.

1112
01:25:57,732 --> 01:25:58,802
Landing track locked.

1113
01:26:10,652 --> 01:26:11,722
We're landing.

1114
01:26:14,972 --> 01:26:16,452
We're coming in.

1115
01:26:21,332 --> 01:26:22,368
Saw Gerrera used to say...

1116
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:27,163
one fighter with a sharp stick
and nothing left to lose can take the day.

1117
01:26:31,132 --> 01:26:33,010
They've no idea we're coming.

1118
01:26:33,812 --> 01:26:35,929
They've no reason to expect us.

1119
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:38,132
If we can make it to the ground,

1120
01:26:38,212 --> 01:26:39,805
we'll take the next chance.

1121
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:43,724
And the next.
On and on until we win...

1122
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:48,044
or the chances are spent.

1123
01:26:50,612 --> 01:26:53,002
The Death Star plans are down there.

1124
01:26:54,052 --> 01:26:57,409
Cassian, K-2,
and I will find them.

1125
01:26:59,092 --> 01:27:00,731
We'll find a way to find them.

1126
01:27:02,532 --> 01:27:03,409
Melshi...

1127
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:05,323
Pao...

1128
01:27:05,532 --> 01:27:06,568
Baze, Chirrut...

1129
01:27:06,772 --> 01:27:08,206
you'll take the main squad.

1130
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:09,965
Move east and get wide of the ship.

1131
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:12,368
Find a position between
here and the tower.

1132
01:27:13,292 --> 01:27:14,487
Once you get to the best spot...

1133
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,408
light the place up.

1134
01:27:17,852 --> 01:27:19,844
Make 10 men feel like 100.

1135
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:24,083
And get those troopers away from us.

1136
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:26,171
What should I do?

1137
01:27:26,332 --> 01:27:27,686
Keep the engine running.

1138
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:30,487
You're our only way outta here.

1139
01:28:00,132 --> 01:28:03,728
Cargo shuttle SW-0608...

1140
01:28:03,972 --> 01:28:06,282
be prepared to receive inspection team.

1141
01:28:06,492 --> 01:28:07,482
Ready?

1142
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:22,643
Hello.

1143
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:23,842
Hey.

1144
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:26,208
Oh, you're probably
looking for a manifest?

1145
01:28:26,412 --> 01:28:27,289
That would be helpful.

1146
01:28:29,212 --> 01:28:30,612
It's just down here.

1147
01:28:39,052 --> 01:28:40,088
Director Krennic,

1148
01:28:40,172 --> 01:28:42,050
we are entering the Scarif shield gate.

1149
01:28:42,212 --> 01:28:44,886
General Ramda has been
informed of your arrival.

1150
01:29:09,172 --> 01:29:10,401
Good luck...

1151
01:29:10,652 --> 01:29:12,211
little sister.

1152
01:29:18,212 --> 01:29:19,726
Go! Go now! You're clear!

1153
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:23,201
All right, let's go! Come on.
Move, move, move.

1154
01:29:26,812 --> 01:29:30,362
925-H to transport control.

1155
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:34,003
925-H to transport control.

1156
01:29:52,572 --> 01:29:53,722
I've got a bad feeling about...

1157
01:29:53,932 --> 01:29:54,922
- K!
- Quiet!

1158
01:29:55,132 --> 01:29:56,202
What?

1159
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:33,932
We need a map.

1160
01:30:34,092 --> 01:30:36,652
Well, I'm sure there's one
just lying about.

1161
01:30:37,132 --> 01:30:39,328
You know what you have to do.

1162
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:10,643
One per pad.

1163
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:12,804
Pick your spot.
We wanna draw them out.

1164
01:31:13,492 --> 01:31:15,529
I'll call the timing.
Go!

1165
01:31:18,092 --> 01:31:19,367
Hey, did you hear the rumors?

1166
01:31:19,532 --> 01:31:21,285
Yeah, the T-15s have
been marked obsolete.

1167
01:31:21,452 --> 01:31:23,171
Oh boy, it's about time for that.

1168
01:31:24,092 --> 01:31:25,048
Hey!

1169
01:31:47,012 --> 01:31:48,332
What the...

1170
01:31:53,972 --> 01:31:55,691
Director, what brings you to Scarif?

1171
01:31:55,772 --> 01:31:57,047
Galen Erso.

1172
01:31:57,252 --> 01:31:58,811
I want every dispatch,

1173
01:31:58,892 --> 01:32:01,407
every transmission he has ever sent...

1174
01:32:01,572 --> 01:32:02,892
called up for inspection.

1175
01:32:04,052 --> 01:32:05,042
All of them?

1176
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:07,041
Yes, all of them.

1177
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:09,442
Get started.

1178
01:32:41,612 --> 01:32:42,602
K.

1179
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:44,891
Our optimal route to the data vault

1180
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:47,441
places only 89 Stormtroopers in our path.

1181
01:32:47,612 --> 01:32:49,843
We will make it
no more than 33% of the way

1182
01:32:49,972 --> 01:32:51,088
before we are killed.

1183
01:32:57,652 --> 01:32:58,768
Melshi, talk to me.

1184
01:32:58,932 --> 01:33:01,003
Ready. Ready.
Standing by.

1185
01:33:06,172 --> 01:33:07,208
Light it up.

1186
01:33:15,332 --> 01:33:16,368
Come on.

1187
01:33:31,052 --> 01:33:32,281
Are we blind?

1188
01:33:32,492 --> 01:33:33,972
Deploy the garrison!

1189
01:33:34,132 --> 01:33:35,202
Move!

1190
01:33:53,812 --> 01:33:54,643
Troopers!

1191
01:33:56,252 --> 01:33:57,447
Troopers! Troopers on the left.

1192
01:33:57,612 --> 01:33:59,092
Get in! Get in!

1193
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,328
Sir, it's Scarif base.

1194
01:34:25,412 --> 01:34:26,971
They're reporting a Rebel incursion.

1195
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:28,645
I want to speak with Director Krennic.

1196
01:34:28,852 --> 01:34:30,923
He's there, sir.
On Scarif.

1197
01:34:31,852 --> 01:34:34,651
The original plans for this station
are kept there, are they not?

1198
01:34:34,812 --> 01:34:35,404
They are.

1199
01:34:36,532 --> 01:34:40,409
Prepare for the jump to hyperspace
and inform Lord Vader.

1200
01:34:47,972 --> 01:34:49,008
Can we help you?

1201
01:34:49,212 --> 01:34:50,328
That won't be necessary.

1202
01:35:05,812 --> 01:35:07,371
Senator!

1203
01:35:09,092 --> 01:35:10,367
Senator!

1204
01:35:10,572 --> 01:35:11,722
Stop right there, Private.

1205
01:35:11,892 --> 01:35:13,212
Let him speak.

1206
01:35:14,212 --> 01:35:16,363
Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am.

1207
01:35:16,572 --> 01:35:18,131
Rebels on Scarif.

1208
01:35:18,892 --> 01:35:20,611
I need to speak with Admiral Raddus.

1209
01:35:20,772 --> 01:35:22,650
He's returned to his ship.

1210
01:35:22,812 --> 01:35:24,485
He's going to fight.

1211
01:35:35,732 --> 01:35:36,722
No!

1212
01:35:42,012 --> 01:35:43,890
Attention, all flight personnel,

1213
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:45,531
please report to
your commanders immediately.

1214
01:35:46,972 --> 01:35:49,972
All flight personnel, please report
to your commanders immediately.

1215
01:35:51,252 --> 01:35:53,244
We have been redirected to Scarif.

1216
01:35:54,012 --> 01:35:55,651
Pilots, you'll be briefed

1217
01:35:55,772 --> 01:35:57,650
by your squadron leaders en route.

1218
01:35:58,332 --> 01:36:00,244
May the Force be with you.

1219
01:36:00,932 --> 01:36:03,527
Scarif? They're going to Scarif?

1220
01:36:03,732 --> 01:36:06,247
Why does nobody ever tell me anything, R2?

1221
01:36:09,612 --> 01:36:11,205
Move, move, move!

1222
01:36:15,052 --> 01:36:17,567
Forward! Forward!

1223
01:36:17,732 --> 01:36:19,849
Keep drawing them out!

1224
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:27,282
Pad 12, report to ground.

1225
01:36:27,452 --> 01:36:28,602
Coming in on our flank.
We need numbers.

1226
01:36:28,812 --> 01:36:30,132
Pad 14, what's going on down there?

1227
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:33,012
Status please.
All pads report in immediately.

1228
01:36:33,172 --> 01:36:34,447
Oh, no.
We have rebels everywhere!

1229
01:36:34,572 --> 01:36:35,642
We're taking fire!

1230
01:36:35,812 --> 01:36:37,963
Pad 12, Pad 14 request assistance.

1231
01:36:38,852 --> 01:36:40,286
This is Pad
2. Pad 2.

1232
01:36:40,492 --> 01:36:42,449
I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2.

1233
01:36:42,652 --> 01:36:44,803
Get on there. Tell him you're
pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.

1234
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:47,692
This is Pad 5!
We're being overrun! Help us!

1235
01:36:48,012 --> 01:36:49,924
Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.

1236
01:36:50,012 --> 01:36:51,366
Confirm and report.

1237
01:36:52,332 --> 01:36:54,528
Get reinforcements down
to Pad 5 immediately!

1238
01:36:57,692 --> 01:36:59,490
This is not working, K!

1239
01:37:00,492 --> 01:37:01,562
Right hand.

1240
01:37:23,012 --> 01:37:24,002
Baze!

1241
01:37:25,652 --> 01:37:26,608
- Baze!
- What?

1242
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:28,172
Run!

1243
01:37:33,212 --> 01:37:35,329
Karabast! AT-AT!

1244
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:38,404
Move!

1245
01:37:56,092 --> 01:37:58,323
This is Admiral Raddus
of the Rebel Alliance.

1246
01:37:59,052 --> 01:38:01,408
All squadron leaders, report in.

1247
01:38:01,612 --> 01:38:04,047
Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.

1248
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,568
This is Gold Leader standing by.

1249
01:38:06,772 --> 01:38:09,003
This is Red Leader standing by.

1250
01:38:09,172 --> 01:38:11,403
Sir, those are rebel ships.

1251
01:38:11,892 --> 01:38:13,565
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately!

1252
01:38:14,572 --> 01:38:16,370
Director, the rebel fleet,

1253
01:38:16,452 --> 01:38:18,091
it's amassing outside the shield.

1254
01:38:20,892 --> 01:38:22,565
Lock down the base.
Lock it down.

1255
01:38:22,692 --> 01:38:24,411
- And close the shield?
- Do it!

1256
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:27,447
Red and Gold Squadrons, attack formations.

1257
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,086
Defend the fleet.

1258
01:38:29,252 --> 01:38:31,164
Blue Squadron, get to the surface

1259
01:38:31,252 --> 01:38:32,572
before they close that gate.

1260
01:38:32,732 --> 01:38:33,529
Copy you, Admiral.

1261
01:38:33,652 --> 01:38:35,325
Blue Squadron, on me!

1262
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:36,243
Copy, Blue Leader.

1263
01:38:36,372 --> 01:38:38,250
- Copy, Blue Leader.
- We won't have long.

1264
01:38:50,092 --> 01:38:52,926
Close the field aperture now! Close it!

1265
01:38:58,332 --> 01:38:58,970
Come on, come on, come on!

1266
01:39:00,012 --> 01:39:00,604
Pull up!

1267
01:39:13,612 --> 01:39:14,762
The rebel fleet has arrived.

1268
01:39:14,932 --> 01:39:15,922
What?

1269
01:39:16,092 --> 01:39:17,492
There's fighting on the beach.

1270
01:39:17,692 --> 01:39:19,604
They've locked down the base.

1271
01:39:19,692 --> 01:39:20,921
They've closed the shield gate.

1272
01:39:21,092 --> 01:39:22,367
What does that mean?

1273
01:39:24,972 --> 01:39:25,962
We're trapped?

1274
01:39:27,652 --> 01:39:30,406
We could transmit the plans
to the rebel fleet.

1275
01:39:30,612 --> 01:39:33,684
We'd have to get a signal up
to tell them it's coming.

1276
01:39:33,852 --> 01:39:34,968
It's the size of the data files.

1277
01:39:35,092 --> 01:39:36,208
That's the problem.

1278
01:39:36,372 --> 01:39:37,886
They'll never get through.

1279
01:39:38,492 --> 01:39:40,563
Someone has to take that shield gate down.

1280
01:39:41,172 --> 01:39:43,129
Bodhi. Bodhi,
can you hear me?

1281
01:39:43,372 --> 01:39:45,011
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.

1282
01:39:46,012 --> 01:39:47,048
Bodhi?

1283
01:39:47,212 --> 01:39:48,532
I'm here.

1284
01:39:48,692 --> 01:39:49,762
I was standing by.

1285
01:39:49,972 --> 01:39:51,372
They've started fighting.
The base is on lockdown.

1286
01:39:51,532 --> 01:39:54,445
I know. Listen to me.
The rebel fleet is up there.

1287
01:39:54,612 --> 01:39:56,524
You've gotta tell them to
blow a hole in the shield gate...

1288
01:39:56,732 --> 01:39:58,849
so we can transmit the plans.

1289
01:39:59,012 --> 01:40:02,130
Wait. I can't. I'm not hooked
into the comms tower.

1290
01:40:02,292 --> 01:40:03,328
We're not tied in.

1291
01:40:03,492 --> 01:40:05,404
It's the only way
we're getting them out of here.

1292
01:40:05,612 --> 01:40:06,329
Find a way!

1293
01:40:07,172 --> 01:40:08,526
Cover our backs.

1294
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:11,728
You'll need this.

1295
01:40:14,132 --> 01:40:15,122
You wanted one, right?

1296
01:40:17,572 --> 01:40:22,408
Your behavior, Jyn Erso,
is continually unexpected.

1297
01:40:23,212 --> 01:40:25,283
Jyn. Come on.

1298
01:40:44,812 --> 01:40:46,041
Sa'kalla!

1299
01:40:46,132 --> 01:40:47,964
Fire on my command.

1300
01:41:03,252 --> 01:41:03,844
Look!

1301
01:41:15,252 --> 01:41:16,606
Get ready.
We're gonna have to go out there.

1302
01:41:19,612 --> 01:41:20,602
What are you doing?

1303
01:41:21,532 --> 01:41:23,410
They've closed the shield gate.

1304
01:41:23,572 --> 01:41:25,245
We're stuck here.

1305
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:26,766
But the rebel fleet are pulling in.

1306
01:41:26,892 --> 01:41:29,009
We just have to get a signal
strong enough to get through to them...

1307
01:41:29,092 --> 01:41:31,368
and let them know
that we're trapped down here.

1308
01:41:31,572 --> 01:41:33,325
For that, we have to connect
to the communications tower.

1309
01:41:33,532 --> 01:41:35,683
Now, I can patch us in over here,
the landing pad.

1310
01:41:35,852 --> 01:41:37,047
But you have to get on the radio.

1311
01:41:37,212 --> 01:41:40,284
Get one of the guys out there
to find a master switch.

1312
01:41:40,452 --> 01:41:42,808
Get them to activate the connection
between us and that comms tower.

1313
01:41:43,052 --> 01:41:43,724
Okay?

1314
01:41:43,892 --> 01:41:45,212
Then go!

1315
01:41:48,572 --> 01:41:50,609
What's going on down there, Lieutenant?

1316
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:51,967
Unknown, sir.

1317
01:41:52,132 --> 01:41:53,202
We can't raise them.

1318
01:41:53,292 --> 01:41:54,442
All rebel frequencies are blocked.

1319
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:59,810
Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers
and let's start probing that shield!

1320
01:41:59,932 --> 01:42:01,127
Yes, sir!

1321
01:42:02,812 --> 01:42:04,292
We're going in.

1322
01:42:10,092 --> 01:42:11,242
Stay with me.

1323
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:50,012
Schematic bank, data tower two.

1324
01:42:50,172 --> 01:42:51,208
How do I find that?

1325
01:42:51,372 --> 01:42:52,852
Searching.

1326
01:42:53,652 --> 01:42:54,802
I can locate the tape,

1327
01:42:54,892 --> 01:42:57,123
but you'll need to use
the handles for extraction.

1328
01:43:01,212 --> 01:43:03,647
What am I supposed to do with this?

1329
01:43:04,732 --> 01:43:06,325
Whoa!

1330
01:43:21,812 --> 01:43:22,689
Well, finally.

1331
01:43:22,932 --> 01:43:24,286
Wait! Stop!

1332
01:43:24,452 --> 01:43:27,331
The rebels, they went over there.

1333
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:29,723
K, what's going on out there?

1334
01:43:29,932 --> 01:43:30,729
There's one.

1335
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:32,723
Ah, well.

1336
01:43:43,892 --> 01:43:44,803
Come on!

1337
01:43:52,492 --> 01:43:54,165
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1338
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:56,568
We're starting our attack run
on the shield gate.

1339
01:43:56,732 --> 01:43:58,963
Keep it tight, and watch out
for those towers.

1340
01:44:12,772 --> 01:44:15,924
More fighters.
Form out at six-five.

1341
01:44:16,652 --> 01:44:19,531
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

1342
01:44:25,972 --> 01:44:28,965
Melshi! Melshi, come in.
Are you there?

1343
01:44:29,132 --> 01:44:31,442
Bodhi sent a signal from here.
He's patching us in.

1344
01:44:31,612 --> 01:44:33,569
But you guys have to open up
a line for the tower.

1345
01:44:33,732 --> 01:44:35,291
How? Please advise.

1346
01:44:35,452 --> 01:44:37,683
There's a master switch
at the base of the comm tower.

1347
01:44:37,852 --> 01:44:40,321
Master switch? Describe.
What are we looking for?

1348
01:44:40,532 --> 01:44:43,604
What does it look like?
The master switch? Where is it?

1349
01:44:43,852 --> 01:44:46,367
U-wings, reinforce those
troops on the beach.

1350
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:48,052
All fighters, on me.

1351
01:44:48,252 --> 01:44:49,766
We have to shield them from air attack.

1352
01:44:51,532 --> 01:44:53,763
Troop reinforcements.
Here we go.

1353
01:44:56,692 --> 01:44:59,366
For Jedha!

1354
01:45:05,252 --> 01:45:07,323
We're having no effect on that shield.

1355
01:45:07,452 --> 01:45:09,171
How much more can that thing take?

1356
01:45:11,892 --> 01:45:14,168
Stick close, Red Five.
Where are you goin'?

1357
01:45:15,012 --> 01:45:16,924
They're all over me.
I'm trying to lose them!

1358
01:45:18,332 --> 01:45:20,483
This is Red Five! I need help!

1359
01:45:26,932 --> 01:45:29,492
"Hyperspace tracking.
Navigational systems."

1360
01:45:31,252 --> 01:45:32,242
Two screens down.

1361
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:34,324
"Structural engineering." Open that one.

1362
01:45:36,772 --> 01:45:37,649
I've got one on my tail!

1363
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:39,848
I'm on him!

1364
01:45:53,692 --> 01:45:58,164
Project code names: "Stellarsphere,
Mark Omega, Pax Aurora."

1365
01:46:09,972 --> 01:46:14,410
"War-Mantle, Cluster Prism,
Blacksaber."

1366
01:46:15,132 --> 01:46:16,202
What?

1367
01:46:16,332 --> 01:46:17,652
"Stardust."

1368
01:46:19,892 --> 01:46:20,882
That's it.

1369
01:46:21,052 --> 01:46:22,850
How do you know that?

1370
01:46:23,772 --> 01:46:25,092
I know because it's me.

1371
01:46:28,252 --> 01:46:30,767
Hey, you! Identify yourself.

1372
01:46:34,132 --> 01:46:35,725
I can...

1373
01:46:36,532 --> 01:46:37,602
Incoming fire! Get cover!

1374
01:46:45,972 --> 01:46:47,770
K, we need the file for Stardust.

1375
01:46:51,812 --> 01:46:52,643
Stardust.

1376
01:46:57,012 --> 01:46:57,763
That's it.

1377
01:47:19,612 --> 01:47:20,284
K?

1378
01:47:20,972 --> 01:47:21,928
Climb.

1379
01:47:22,132 --> 01:47:23,122
Climb.

1380
01:47:23,932 --> 01:47:26,970
You can still send the plans to the fleet.

1381
01:47:27,932 --> 01:47:29,207
If they open the shield gate...

1382
01:47:29,372 --> 01:47:31,489
you can broadcast from the tower.

1383
01:47:32,692 --> 01:47:34,046
Locking the vault door now.

1384
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:35,083
K?

1385
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:36,169
K!

1386
01:47:36,332 --> 01:47:37,846
- Goodbye.
- K!

1387
01:47:55,132 --> 01:47:57,806
Sir, unauthorized access
at the data vault.

1388
01:47:58,972 --> 01:47:59,928
What?

1389
01:48:00,012 --> 01:48:01,651
It's just come in, sir.

1390
01:48:05,572 --> 01:48:07,245
Send my guard squadron into battle.

1391
01:48:07,332 --> 01:48:09,085
Two men with me, now.

1392
01:48:09,652 --> 01:48:12,326
Get that beach under control!

1393
01:48:13,652 --> 01:48:16,121
Bodhi, are you there?
Did you call the fleet?

1394
01:48:16,772 --> 01:48:18,047
I can't get to the shuttle.

1395
01:48:19,252 --> 01:48:20,368
I can't plug in.

1396
01:48:21,052 --> 01:48:23,169
You have to.
They have to hit that gate.

1397
01:48:23,332 --> 01:48:25,688
If the shield's open,
we can send the plans.

1398
01:48:56,172 --> 01:48:58,050
General, behind you!

1399
01:49:11,412 --> 01:49:12,209
Step back.

1400
01:49:21,532 --> 01:49:23,046
We're going down!

1401
01:49:29,052 --> 01:49:30,008
Come on!

1402
01:50:31,772 --> 01:50:32,967
Melshi, Melshi.

1403
01:50:33,132 --> 01:50:34,361
Come in, please.

1404
01:50:34,572 --> 01:50:35,801
I'm tied in at my end.

1405
01:50:35,972 --> 01:50:36,962
I just need an open line.

1406
01:50:37,652 --> 01:50:38,688
Hang on.

1407
01:50:40,412 --> 01:50:41,448
The master switch.

1408
01:50:42,252 --> 01:50:43,971
It's over near that console.

1409
01:50:47,732 --> 01:50:48,483
I'm going!

1410
01:50:58,332 --> 01:50:59,448
I've got it!

1411
01:51:01,772 --> 01:51:02,762
Careful!

1412
01:51:03,652 --> 01:51:04,449
You okay?

1413
01:51:14,012 --> 01:51:14,968
Jyn!

1414
01:51:32,612 --> 01:51:37,367
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1415
01:51:37,572 --> 01:51:38,244
Chirrut!

1416
01:51:48,332 --> 01:51:51,325
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1417
01:51:51,492 --> 01:51:53,085
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1418
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:54,322
I'm one with the Force...

1419
01:51:54,532 --> 01:51:56,489
the Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force...

1420
01:51:56,652 --> 01:51:57,563
and the Force is with me.

1421
01:51:57,732 --> 01:52:02,409
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

1422
01:52:03,132 --> 01:52:04,885
Chirrut! Come back!

1423
01:52:05,092 --> 01:52:05,889
I'm one with the Force...

1424
01:52:14,572 --> 01:52:15,562
Yes!

1425
01:52:20,212 --> 01:52:21,362
Keep going! Keep going!

1426
01:52:25,932 --> 01:52:27,764
Cassian!

1427
01:52:37,092 --> 01:52:39,288
Chirrut! Come! Come with me!

1428
01:52:44,252 --> 01:52:45,572
Chirrut!

1429
01:52:51,212 --> 01:52:52,123
Chirrut.

1430
01:52:52,692 --> 01:52:54,763
Don't go.
Don't go.

1431
01:52:54,932 --> 01:52:56,446
I'm here, I'm here.

1432
01:52:57,292 --> 01:52:58,646
It's okay.

1433
01:52:59,332 --> 01:53:03,008
It's okay.
Look for the Force.

1434
01:53:03,212 --> 01:53:04,487
Chirrut.

1435
01:53:04,692 --> 01:53:07,366
And you will always find me.

1436
01:53:08,492 --> 01:53:12,122
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1437
01:53:13,492 --> 01:53:17,372
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1438
01:53:17,932 --> 01:53:22,688
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1439
01:53:36,332 --> 01:53:39,166
Deflector shields down to 50%!
We're sustaining heavy damage!

1440
01:53:40,012 --> 01:53:41,287
There's no turning back now!

1441
01:53:41,452 --> 01:53:42,932
We have to press the attack!

1442
01:53:49,332 --> 01:53:50,322
Hit that opening!

1443
01:53:50,492 --> 01:53:51,562
We see it, Gold Leader.

1444
01:53:51,772 --> 01:53:53,331
Ion torpedoes away!

1445
01:54:03,212 --> 01:54:04,168
What's happening?

1446
01:54:04,332 --> 01:54:06,005
We've lost engine power, sir.

1447
01:54:09,132 --> 01:54:11,169
That Star Destroyer's disabled.

1448
01:54:12,852 --> 01:54:15,731
This is Rogue One calling
any Alliance ships that can hear me.

1449
01:54:17,852 --> 01:54:19,047
Is there anybody out there?
This is Rogue One.

1450
01:54:19,212 --> 01:54:20,202
Come in, over!

1451
01:54:20,532 --> 01:54:22,524
This is Admiral Raddus,
Rogue One. We hear you.

1452
01:54:25,372 --> 01:54:26,852
We have the plans.

1453
01:54:27,692 --> 01:54:28,682
They found the Death Star plans.

1454
01:54:28,892 --> 01:54:30,849
They have to transmit them
from the communications tower.

1455
01:54:31,012 --> 01:54:32,082
You have to take down the shield gate.

1456
01:54:32,292 --> 01:54:34,329
It's the only way
they're gonna get them through.

1457
01:54:35,492 --> 01:54:38,564
Call up a Hammerhead corvette.
I have an idea.

1458
01:54:38,772 --> 01:54:40,206
Stand by, Rogue One.
We're on it.

1459
01:54:40,412 --> 01:54:42,051
This is for you, Galen.

1460
01:55:11,172 --> 01:55:14,404
The Force is with me,
and I'm one with the Force.

1461
01:56:05,492 --> 01:56:07,165
Corvette Five, locked on target!

1462
01:56:08,772 --> 01:56:09,922
Prepare for impact.

1463
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:23,690
Sublight thrusters, full power!

1464
01:57:00,692 --> 01:57:02,763
Reset antenna alignment.

1465
01:57:04,452 --> 01:57:05,852
Reset antenna alignment.

1466
01:57:07,092 --> 01:57:08,845
Reset antenna alignment.

1467
01:57:10,372 --> 01:57:12,204
Reset antenna alignment.

1468
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:38,084
Reverse engines! Full power!

1469
01:57:59,492 --> 01:58:00,403
Antenna aligned.

1470
01:58:00,852 --> 01:58:02,127
Ready to transmit.

1471
01:58:36,972 --> 01:58:37,962
Who are you?

1472
01:58:40,292 --> 01:58:41,567
You know who I am.

1473
01:58:44,612 --> 01:58:45,807
I'm Jyn Erso.

1474
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:48,330
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.

1475
01:58:48,972 --> 01:58:49,769
You've lost.

1476
01:58:50,652 --> 01:58:52,052
Oh, I have, have I?

1477
01:58:52,412 --> 01:58:53,892
My father's revenge.

1478
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:55,572
He built a flaw in the Death Star.

1479
01:58:55,812 --> 01:58:57,644
He put a fuse in the middle
of your machine...

1480
01:58:57,812 --> 01:58:59,769
and I've just told the entire galaxy
how to light it.

1481
01:59:00,812 --> 01:59:03,247
The shield is up.

1482
01:59:03,412 --> 01:59:05,768
Your signal will never reach
the rebel base.

1483
01:59:05,932 --> 01:59:07,969
All your ships in the air
will be destroyed.

1484
01:59:08,172 --> 01:59:09,970
I lose nothing but time.

1485
01:59:10,412 --> 01:59:12,210
You, on the other hand...

1486
01:59:13,132 --> 01:59:15,408
die with the Rebellion.

1487
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:47,282
Transmitting.

1488
01:59:49,652 --> 01:59:50,688
Transmitting.

1489
01:59:52,692 --> 01:59:55,730
Admiral, receiving
transmission from Scarif.

1490
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:07,205
Leave it, leave it!

1491
02:00:07,452 --> 02:00:08,522
That's it.

1492
02:00:09,772 --> 02:00:10,922
That's it.

1493
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:13,362
Let's go.

1494
02:00:13,772 --> 02:00:15,411
Transmission received.

1495
02:00:15,612 --> 02:00:17,888
Admiral, we have the plans!

1496
02:00:18,212 --> 02:00:19,532
She did it!

1497
02:00:21,252 --> 02:00:24,165
Do you think anybody's listening?

1498
02:00:25,132 --> 02:00:26,327
I do.

1499
02:00:27,932 --> 02:00:29,810
Someone's out there.

1500
02:00:32,012 --> 02:00:36,368
Sir, we're detecting a massive object
emerging from hyperspace.

1501
02:00:42,212 --> 02:00:44,010
Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?

1502
02:00:44,172 --> 02:00:45,322
Lord Vader will handle the fleet.

1503
02:00:46,212 --> 02:00:49,728
Target the base at Scarif,
single reactor ignition.

1504
02:00:49,892 --> 02:00:51,087
Yes, sir.

1505
02:00:56,292 --> 02:00:57,282
Come on.

1506
02:01:21,132 --> 02:01:23,283
You may fire when ready.

1507
02:01:28,292 --> 02:01:29,851
Commence primary ignition.

1508
02:01:52,012 --> 02:01:55,323
Rogue One, may the Force be with you.

1509
02:01:59,252 --> 02:02:02,484
All ships prepare for
jump to hyperspace.

1510
02:02:35,052 --> 02:02:37,169
Your father would have been
proud of you, Jyn.

1511
02:02:51,492 --> 02:02:53,723
The rebel flagship is disabled, my lord...

1512
02:02:53,892 --> 02:02:56,088
but has received transmissions
from the surface.

1513
02:02:56,532 --> 02:02:58,808
Prepare a boarding party.

1514
02:02:59,052 --> 02:03:00,532
Yes, my lord.

1515
02:03:36,412 --> 02:03:37,129
Hurry!

1516
02:03:41,092 --> 02:03:43,129
Let's go! We gotta go, now!

1517
02:03:44,932 --> 02:03:46,605
Move! Move! Move!

1518
02:03:47,652 --> 02:03:48,927
Hurry.
Let's go!

1519
02:03:49,092 --> 02:03:50,082
Let's go!

1520
02:03:50,212 --> 02:03:51,202
It's stuck!

1521
02:03:52,612 --> 02:03:53,602
Hey!

1522
02:03:53,972 --> 02:03:55,292
Hey! Help!

1523
02:04:12,172 --> 02:04:13,288
Open fire!

1524
02:04:19,292 --> 02:04:20,123
Help us!

1525
02:04:24,132 --> 02:04:24,724
It's jammed!

1526
02:04:26,172 --> 02:04:26,810
Pull it!

1527
02:04:32,692 --> 02:04:33,443
Pull it!

1528
02:04:37,572 --> 02:04:38,847
Here! Here!

1529
02:04:39,332 --> 02:04:40,607
Take it! Take it!

1530
02:04:48,492 --> 02:04:49,323
Launch!

1531
02:05:17,132 --> 02:05:18,805
Make sure you secure the airlock.

1532
02:05:18,892 --> 02:05:20,690
And prepare the escape pods.

1533
02:05:25,012 --> 02:05:25,843
Your highness.

1534
02:05:26,772 --> 02:05:28,650
The transmission we received.

1535
02:05:29,692 --> 02:05:31,365
What is it they've sent us?

1536
02:05:33,052 --> 02:05:34,486
Hope.

1537
02:05:34,586 --> 02:06:34,486
