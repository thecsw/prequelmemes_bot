1
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:19,376
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,609
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,167
We made it.

4
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,371
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:22,671
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,158
CordÂ¨Â¦.

7
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,469
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,464
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:51,699
No.

10
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,368
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:07,118
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:11,052
You did your duty.
CordÂ¨Â¦ did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,022
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,703
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,346
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,280
If they do break away...

17
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:38,649
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:40,813
be split in two.

19
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:43,892
My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,558
If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,755
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,395
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

23
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,564
Master Yoda...

24
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,201
do you think it will
really come to war?

25
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,010
The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:10,074
Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:15,152
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

28
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:16,246
Good.

29
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:20,955
Send them in.

30
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,896
We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:31,972
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

32
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,974
terrible.

33
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:37,872
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,710
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:45,412
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,381
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

37
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:52,393
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

38
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:55,487
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:59,056
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

40
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,728
But for certain, Senator...

41
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:05,671
in grave danger you are.

42
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:09,743
MasterJedi, may I suggest...

43
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:13,941
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

44
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,110
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,346
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

46
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,787
The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,349
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,793
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:31,389
might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,162
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

51
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:38,303
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,699
That's possible.

53
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,540
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,841
Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,349
The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,146
is unbearable.

57
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:57,220
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,556
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:12,470
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

60
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:16,204
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,937
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,482
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,976
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:33,486
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,691
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,110
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:57,879
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, JarJar.

68
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,978
Senator PadmÂ¨Â¦.

69
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,684
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,523
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,095
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,693
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:18,505
Ani?

74
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:21,906
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

75
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,411
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:27,209
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:32,713
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,748
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,328
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,488
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,725
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,598
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:50,399
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

84
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:52,736
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:56,676
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,179
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, PadmÂ¨Â¦.

87
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,112
I promise you.

88
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,947
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:07,022
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,624
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,693
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

92
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:13,853
- Why?
- What?

93
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:19,462
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:22,867
Protection is a job
for local security, notJedi.

95
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:25,805
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:29,173
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,672
And you will learn
your place, young one.

98
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,212
Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:43,257
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,953
Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,890
I will retire.

102
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,324
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

103
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,594
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

104
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:55,863
and I'll be in the control center
downstairs.

105
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:00,498
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:03,737
She hardly even
recognized me, JarJar.

107
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:08,316
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

108
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,653
she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,415
Shesa happy.

110
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,922
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

111
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:19,825
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,597
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:24,666
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,770
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:38,142
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,272
My client is getting impatient.

117
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:43,215
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:46,755
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:52,526
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:54,562
No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,690
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:02,067
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

123
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:05,703
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

124
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,467
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

125
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,477
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,571
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

127
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:16,310
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

128
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:20,752
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,985
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,153
It was her idea.

131
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,822
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:32,901
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:35,266
Trust me.

134
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,271
It's too risky.

135
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,970
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:43,402
And yours are?

137
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:47,479
Possibly.

138
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,798
You look tired.

139
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,524
I don't sleep well anymore.

140
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:09,126
Because of your mother?

141
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,107
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,782
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:25,912
I'd much rather dream about PadmÂ¨Â¦.

144
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:30,219
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

145
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,793
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,227
You've made a commitment
to theJedi order...

147
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,389
a commitment not easily broken.

148
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:40,263
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

149
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:42,963
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

150
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:45,199
It is my experience
that senators focus...

151
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,207
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

152
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:52,505
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

153
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,809
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

154
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,715
At least not
on the economics of politics.

155
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:56,072
And besides, you're generalizing.

156
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:58,237
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

157
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:00,008
Palpatine is a politician.

158
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:02,743
I have observed
that he is very clever...

159
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:06,844
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

160
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,820
I think he's a good man...

161
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,824
I sense it too.

162
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:30,004
Stay here!

163
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,347
Are you all right, milady?

164
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,011
What the...

165
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,321
Jedi poo doo!

166
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:24,455
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

167
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,460
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

168
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:30,963
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

169
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,864
If you spent as long practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...

170
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,698
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

171
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:37,499
I thought I already did.

172
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,302
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

173
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:11,238
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

174
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,474
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

175
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:23,846
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

176
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:26,750
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

177
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,019
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

178
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,348
stay away from power couplings!

179
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:04,355
That was good!

180
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,433
Where are you going?
He went that way.

181
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,569
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

182
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,670
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

183
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:31,082
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

184
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,848
This is a shortcut... I think.

185
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,515
Well, you've lost him.

186
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,111
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

187
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,121
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

188
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:10,657
He went completely the other way.

189
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,784
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

190
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,924
I hate it when he does that.

191
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,711
Anakin!

192
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:51,650
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

193
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:55,280
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

194
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,154
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,057
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:05,098
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

197
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,895
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

198
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:09,698
Don't say that, Master.

199
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:11,863
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

200
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,838
Then why don't you listen to me?

201
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:15,534
I am trying.

202
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:29,590
Can you see him?

203
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,659
I think he is a she...

204
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,422
and I think she is a changeling.

205
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,658
In that case, be extra careful.

206
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:42,169
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

207
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,737
For a drink.

208
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,146
Thank you.

209
00:22:56,885 --> 00:23:00,343
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

210
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:02,389
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

211
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,583
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

212
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:07,025
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

213
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,507
Easy.

214
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:58,738
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

215
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:08,014
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

216
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,419
It was a senator from Naboo.

217
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:13,221
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

218
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,592
Who hired you? Tell us.

219
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,090
Tell us now!

220
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,900
It was a bounty hunter called...

221
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:32,669
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

222
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:44,088
Toxic dart.

223
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:58,563
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

224
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:02,131
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

225
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:06,145
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

226
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:09,148
Handle that your Padawan will.

227
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,548
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

228
00:25:14,656 --> 00:25:18,387
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

229
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:20,484
Travel as refugees.

230
00:25:20,595 --> 00:25:23,496
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

231
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:25,964
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

232
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:29,768
Until caught this killer is...

233
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:32,931
our judgment she must respect.

234
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:35,501
Anakin, go to the senate...

235
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,773
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

236
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:49,623
I will talk with her.

237
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:52,852
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

238
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:55,122
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

239
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,289
Thank you, Your Excellency.

240
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:00,765
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

241
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:03,861
Your patience has paid off.

242
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,303
Your guidance
more than my patience.

243
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,807
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

244
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:14,137
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

245
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:18,177
Then you will be invincible.

246
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:23,222
I have said it many times:

247
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:26,088
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

248
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:28,094
Thank you, Your Excellency.

249
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:31,893
I see you becoming the greatest
of all theJedi, Anakin...

250
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,525
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

251
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:41,732
I am concerned for my Padawan.

252
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:44,539
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

253
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,910
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

254
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,984
The boy has exceptional skills.

255
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:52,518
But he still has much to learn, Master.

256
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,056
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

257
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,158
Yes.

258
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:01,194
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

259
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:05,698
Too sure of themselves they are.

260
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,258
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

261
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,931
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

262
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:16,670
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

263
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:23,615
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

264
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:26,846
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

265
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,856
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

266
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:34,452
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

267
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:39,129
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

268
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:41,793
JarJar, I don't wish to hold you up.

269
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,871
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

270
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,769
Of course.

271
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:47,632
Milady.

272
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:54,111
I do not like this idea of hiding.

273
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,311
Don't worry.

274
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:58,612
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

275
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:01,415
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

276
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:04,423
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

277
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,584
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

278
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:08,753
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

279
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:11,423
and do what is requested of us.

280
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,966
Anakin, you've grown up.

281
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:18,271
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

282
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:27,774
Don't get me wrong.

283
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:29,713
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

284
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:32,342
As wise as Master Yoda and...

285
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,580
as powerful as Master Windu.

286
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,358
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

287
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,589
In some ways...
a lot of ways...

288
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:48,602
I'm really ahead of him.

289
00:28:49,337 --> 00:28:51,202
I'm ready for the trials...

290
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:54,706
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

291
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,709
He won't let me move on.

292
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,876
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

293
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:02,779
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

294
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:05,250
He doesn't understand.

295
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:07,446
It's not fair!

296
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:12,390
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

297
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:14,484
It's the only way we grow.

298
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:18,030
I know.

299
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,991
Anakin...

300
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:25,896
don't try to grow up too fast.

301
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,998
But I am grown up.

302
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:32,079
You said it yourself.

303
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:35,307
Please don't look at me like that.

304
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:37,774
Why not?

305
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,012
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

306
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:43,991
Sorry, milady.

307
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:02,037
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

308
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:05,203
Take good care of DormÂ¨Â¦.
The threat's on you two now.

309
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:07,281
He'll be safe with me.

310
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,346
You'll be fine.

311
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:16,651
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

312
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:19,089
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

313
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:23,560
Well, then myJedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

314
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:25,564
Anakin...

315
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,760
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

316
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:30,803
Yes, Master.

317
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,498
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

318
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,543
You'll be back here in no time.

319
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:39,875
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, MasterJedi.

320
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:41,881
- It's time to go.
- I know.

321
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:44,508
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

322
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:46,644
May the Force be with you, Master.

323
00:30:58,132 --> 00:30:59,997
Suddenly I'm afraid.

324
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:03,730
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

325
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,267
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

326
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:16,173
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

327
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:20,409
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

328
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:43,935
Someone to see ya, honey!

329
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:46,278
Jedi, by the looks of him.

330
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:48,940
Obi-Wan!

331
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,314
Hello, Dex.

332
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,013
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

333
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:59,393
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

334
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,226
Old buddy!

335
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,579
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

336
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,510
You can tell me what this is.

337
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,247
Well, whattaya know!

338
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,753
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

339
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:31,085
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

340
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:33,626
Can you tell me
where it came from?

341
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,697
This baby belongs to them cloners.

342
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:41,131
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

343
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:44,204
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

344
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:47,604
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

345
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:51,610
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

346
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:54,010
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

347
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:56,447
for the difference
between knowledge and...

348
00:32:57,618 --> 00:32:59,279
wisdom.

349
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:01,378
Well, if droids could think...

350
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:03,548
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

351
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,487
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

352
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:08,562
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

353
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:14,295
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

354
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:18,930
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

355
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:24,640
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

356
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:27,612
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

357
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:31,877
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

358
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:34,220
Depends on what, Dex?

359
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:37,189
On how good your manners are...

360
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:41,591
and how big your... pocketbook is.

361
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,036
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

362
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:57,269
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

363
00:33:57,378 --> 00:34:00,677
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

364
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:03,045
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

365
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,450
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

366
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:09,921
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

367
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:13,016
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

368
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,186
just south of the Rishi Maze.

369
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:25,469
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

370
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:27,268
doesn't exist.

371
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,867
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

372
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:34,038
If an item does not appear
in our records...

373
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:36,207
it does not exist.

374
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:00,235
Hey, you! No droids!

375
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:02,508
Get outta here!

376
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,215
Thank you, R2.

377
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:14,920
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to theJedi...

378
00:35:15,022 --> 00:35:18,924
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

379
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:21,153
Or be with the people that I love.

380
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:24,121
Are you allowed to love?

381
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:26,062
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

382
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:31,901
Attachment is forbidden.

383
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,607
Possession is forbidden.

384
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:39,304
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

385
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:41,847
is central to a Jedi's life.

386
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:48,687
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

387
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:50,723
You've changed so much.

388
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,385
You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:56,361
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

390
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:12,740
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

391
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:15,543
Use your feelings you must.

392
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:22,980
Younglings. Younglings!

393
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,524
A visitor we have.

394
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:28,493
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

395
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:30,062
Hello.

396
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:31,688
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

397
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:34,131
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

398
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:38,504
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

399
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:41,734
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

400
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,177
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

401
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,248
How embarrassing!

402
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:53,676
Liam, the shades.

403
00:36:55,055 --> 00:36:57,523
Gather round the map reader.

404
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,786
Clear your minds...

405
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:03,352
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

406
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:07,728
It ought to be here...

407
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:09,735
but it isn't.

408
00:37:09,837 --> 00:37:13,273
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

409
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,968
Gravity's silhouette remains...

410
00:37:17,077 --> 00:37:20,046
but the star and all the planets...

411
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:22,138
disappeared they have.

412
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:24,376
How can this be?

413
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:27,213
A thought?

414
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:30,020
Anyone.

415
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:31,924
Master?

416
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:34,893
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

417
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:42,134
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

418
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,269
The Padawan is right.

419
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:50,434
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

420
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:54,002
and find your planet you will.

421
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,412
The data must have been erased.

422
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:07,623
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

423
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:11,129
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

424
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:15,600
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

425
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:19,104
But who and why, harder to answer.

426
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:23,040
Meditate on this I will.

427
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:50,199
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

428
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:53,899
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

429
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:55,976
I'm not sure I was ready.

430
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:58,601
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

431
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:01,072
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

432
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,240
so you could stay in office.

433
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,841
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

434
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:09,650
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

435
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,748
I couldn't refuse her.

436
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:15,393
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

437
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:19,625
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

438
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,201
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

439
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,175
It's unthinkable!

440
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,680
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

441
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:38,251
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

442
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:40,445
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

443
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:42,749
Not if they feel threatened.

444
00:39:42,856 --> 00:39:46,223
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

445
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:48,294
It's outrageous...

446
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:50,693
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

447
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:54,598
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

448
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:58,695
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

449
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:03,002
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

450
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:13,944
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

451
00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:16,750
Let's pray that day never comes.

452
00:40:16,857 --> 00:40:19,519
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

453
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,624
What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?

454
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,097
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

455
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,065
- But I was thinking...
- Hold on a minute.

456
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:29,430
Excuse me.

457
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,970
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

458
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:34,302
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

459
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:37,468
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

460
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:41,246
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

461
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,316
I think it would be wise...

462
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,817
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

463
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:49,087
Sorry, milady.

464
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,419
Perfect. It's settled, then.

465
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:11,138
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

466
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,076
Our missing planet Kamino.

467
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:53,116
MasterJedi.

468
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:56,586
The prime minister is expecting you.

469
00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:00,225
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

470
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:03,392
He is anxious to meet you.

471
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:05,692
After all these years...

472
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:09,394
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

473
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:11,733
Now, please, this way.

474
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:27,009
May I present Lama Su...

475
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,145
prime minister of Kamino.

476
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:32,950
And this is MasterJedi...

477
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:35,093
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

478
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:38,494
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

479
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:41,935
Please.

480
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,765
And now to business.

481
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:49,809
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

482
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:52,811
200,000 units are ready...

483
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:55,279
with a million more
well on the way.

484
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,384
That's good news.

485
00:42:58,485 --> 00:43:01,613
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

486
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:05,089
that his order will be met on time.

487
00:43:05,192 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm sorry. Master...

488
00:43:08,328 --> 00:43:10,888
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

489
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:14,126
a leading member of theJedi Council,
is he not?

490
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:18,034
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

491
00:43:19,673 --> 00:43:22,005
I'm so sorry to hear that.

492
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:26,409
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

493
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:28,845
The army?

494
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:32,612
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

495
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,914
one of the finest we've ever created.

496
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:37,023
Tell me, Prime Minister...

497
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:39,615
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

498
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:41,853
did he say who it was for?

499
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:43,987
Of course he did.

500
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:46,759
This army is for the Republic.

501
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:51,229
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

502
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:54,865
That's why I'm here.

503
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:17,856
We used to come here
for school retreat.

504
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,692
We would swim
to that island every day.

505
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:24,971
I love the water.

506
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:33,372
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

507
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:36,816
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

508
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:41,711
I don't like sand.

509
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:46,153
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

510
00:44:46,526 --> 00:44:48,551
and it gets everywhere.

511
00:44:50,764 --> 00:44:52,789
Not like here.

512
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:55,401
Here, everything is soft...

513
00:44:57,537 --> 00:44:59,732
and smooth.

514
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:37,970
No.

515
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:40,670
I shouldn't have done that.

516
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:44,384
I'm sorry.

517
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,625
Very impressive.

518
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:01,860
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

519
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:07,496
Clones can think creatively.

520
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:11,509
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

521
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:20,686
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

522
00:46:20,787 --> 00:46:24,154
This group was created
about five years ago.

523
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:26,316
You mentioned growth acceleration.

524
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,360
Oh, yes, it's essential.

525
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:31,488
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

526
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:34,192
Now we can do it in half the time.

527
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:36,963
I see.

528
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,970
They are totally obedient...

529
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:41,768
taking any order without question.

530
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,934
We modified their genetic structure...

531
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:47,275
to make them less independent
than the original host.

532
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,905
And who was the original host?

533
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,109
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

534
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,813
And where is this bounty hunter now?

535
00:46:55,922 --> 00:46:58,049
Oh, we keep him here.

536
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:03,560
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

537
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:06,154
Fett demanded only one thing:

538
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:08,860
An unaltered clone for himself.

539
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:11,403
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

540
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:14,030
Pure genetic replication.

541
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:17,304
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

542
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,970
and no growth acceleration.

543
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,311
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

544
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,715
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

545
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:47,102
Magnificent, aren't they?

546
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,865
I don't know.

547
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,231
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

548
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:00,705
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

549
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:02,901
They only work on the weak-minded.

550
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:05,972
All right.

551
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,941
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

552
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:10,840
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

553
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:14,011
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

554
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:16,987
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

555
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,581
All right, I get the picture.

556
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,359
Whatever happened to him?

557
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:24,191
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

558
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:26,356
Maybe he was the smart one.

559
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:28,730
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

560
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:30,996
I like two or three...

561
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:33,163
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

562
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:39,379
I don't think the system works.

563
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:42,080
How would you have it work?

564
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:46,423
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

565
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,385
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

566
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:50,961
and then do it.

567
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:53,228
That's exactly what we do.

568
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,324
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

569
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:57,369
Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:00,531
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

571
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,666
- You?
- Of course not me.

572
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:05,778
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

573
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:09,679
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

574
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:13,448
Well, if it works.

575
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:22,324
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

576
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,989
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

577
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,825
Ani, are you all right?

578
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:46,198
Boba, is your father here?

579
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:48,232
Yep.

580
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,403
May we see him?

581
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,345
Sure.

582
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,078
Dad, Taun We's here.

583
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:12,734
Jango, welcome back.

584
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,003
Was your trip productive?

585
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,038
Fairly.

586
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,974
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

587
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,875
He's come to check on our progress.

588
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:27,114
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

589
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:30,208
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

590
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,017
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

591
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,017
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

592
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,857
Possibly.

593
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,057
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

594
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,695
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

595
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,306
Master who?

596
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,369
Sifo-Dyas.

597
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:59,107
Is he not theJedi
who hired you for this job?

598
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,950
Never heard of him.

599
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:07,948
Really?

600
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:13,051
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

601
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:14,789
Curious.

602
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,065
Do you like your army?

603
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,839
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

604
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,509
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

605
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:30,738
Thank you for your time, Jango.

606
00:52:32,515 --> 00:52:34,608
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

607
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:56,267
What is it, Dad?

608
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,631
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

609
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,874
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

610
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,010
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

611
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,612
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

612
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:30,731
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

613
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,333
From the moment I met you...

614
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,600
all those years ago...

615
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,034
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

616
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,181
And now that I'm with you again...

617
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:16,910
I'm in agony.

618
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:24,191
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

619
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:26,727
The thought of not being with you...

620
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,531
I can't breathe.

621
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:35,336
I'm haunted by the kiss...

622
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,407
that you should never have given me.

623
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:41,173
My heart is beating...

624
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:44,212
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

625
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:49,316
You are in my very soul...

626
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:51,443
tormenting me.

627
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:57,415
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,966
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

629
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,743
I can't.

630
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,906
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

631
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:23,008
Anything is possible, PadmÂ¨Â¦.
Listen to me.

632
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,144
No, you listen.

633
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:29,383
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

634
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:33,155
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

635
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,555
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

636
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,135
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

637
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,634
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

638
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,764
Then you do feel something.

639
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,901
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

640
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:51,172
You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,579
That is something
I know I cannot do.

642
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:59,314
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

643
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,447
but I can't.

644
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:05,121
I will not give in to this.

645
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,465
Well, you know...

646
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,403
it wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:20,339
We could keep it a secret.

648
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:23,768
We'd be living a lie...

649
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:26,177
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

650
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,581
I couldn't do that.

651
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:32,552
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

652
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:37,515
No. You're right.

653
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,996
It would destroy us.

654
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:52,373
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

655
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:55,869
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

656
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:59,141
it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,011
I won't forget, and thank you.

658
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,948
Thank you.

659
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,362
R4!

660
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,769
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

661
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:34,680
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

662
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:38,686
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

663
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,256
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

664
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,484
is the assassin we are looking for.

665
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:45,560
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

666
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:47,720
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

667
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,731
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

668
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,734
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

669
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:56,805
Clear your mind must be...

670
00:57:56,939 --> 00:58:01,103
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

671
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,075
Yes, Master.

672
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,239
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

673
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:09,944
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

674
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,689
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

675
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:19,283
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

676
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,295
No. Whoever placed that order...

677
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,695
did not have the authorization
of theJedi Council.

678
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:27,428
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

679
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,639
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

680
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:36,903
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

681
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:39,139
we could not see.

682
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,713
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

683
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,845
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

684
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:52,057
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

685
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,458
If informed the senate is...

686
00:58:54,563 --> 00:58:57,031
multiply our adversaries will.

687
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:00,294
No.

688
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:05,707
Mom, no.

689
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:36,533
Don't go.

690
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,542
I don't want to disturb you.

691
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:43,845
Your presence is soothing.

692
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,842
You had another nightmare last night.

693
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:52,418
Jedi don't have nightmares.

694
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:54,946
I heard you.

695
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:01,886
I saw my mother.

696
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,959
She is suffering, PadmÂ¨Â¦.

697
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:12,635
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

698
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,478
She is in pain.

699
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,991
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

700
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:33,084
but I have to go.

701
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:38,056
I have to help her.

702
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,668
I'll go with you.

703
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,068
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

704
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,015
Dad, look!

705
01:00:57,653 --> 01:01:00,087
Boba, get on board!

706
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,060
Oh, not good.

707
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,096
Wait right there.

708
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,189
Okey-okey.

709
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,230
Chut-chut, Watto.

710
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:39,500
Let me help you with that.

711
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:43,976
What? What do you want?

712
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,547
Wait! You're a Jedi!

713
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,845
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

714
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:57,718
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

715
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,156
Ani?

716
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,829
Little Ani?

717
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,739
Nahhh.

718
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,237
You are Ani! It is you!

719
01:05:16,645 --> 01:05:19,910
You sure sprouted, huh?

720
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:23,274
AJedi! Whattaya know!

721
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:30,457
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

722
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,026
My mother.

723
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:34,618
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

724
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,329
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

725
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:41,732
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

726
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,931
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

727
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:49,840
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

728
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:51,970
At least I think it was Lars.

729
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,572
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

730
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:57,982
Can ya beat that, eh?

731
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,548
Do you know where they are now?

732
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,559
Long way from here.

733
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:10,155
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

734
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:12,256
I'd like to know.

735
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,666
Sure. Absolutely!

736
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,798
Let's go look at my records, huh?

737
01:06:48,193 --> 01:06:51,253
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

738
01:06:51,363 --> 01:06:54,799
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

739
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,198
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

740
01:06:57,303 --> 01:07:00,136
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

741
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,118
Seismic charges!

742
01:07:13,218 --> 01:07:14,549
Stand by.

743
01:07:39,878 --> 01:07:42,540
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

744
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:02,398
Watch out!

745
01:08:22,154 --> 01:08:24,884
Get him, Dad! Fire!

746
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:29,352
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

747
01:08:49,415 --> 01:08:50,905
We got him!

748
01:08:51,016 --> 01:08:53,041
We'll just have to finish him.

749
01:09:18,477 --> 01:09:22,004
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

750
01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:27,918
Fire them now!

751
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:43,435
We won't be seeing him again.

752
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,961
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

753
01:10:40,593 --> 01:10:44,495
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

754
01:11:20,633 --> 01:11:22,567
Stay with the ship, R2.

755
01:11:37,183 --> 01:11:41,085
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C...

756
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:43,087
3PO?

757
01:11:44,957 --> 01:11:46,822
The maker!

758
01:11:46,926 --> 01:11:48,553
Master Ani!

759
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:51,459
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

760
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:53,326
And Miss PadmÂ¨Â¦. Oh, my.

761
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:55,024
Hello, 3PO.

762
01:11:55,134 --> 01:11:59,036
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

763
01:11:59,138 --> 01:12:01,106
I've come to see my mother.

764
01:12:02,942 --> 01:12:04,967
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

765
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:12,441
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

766
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:14,849
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

767
01:12:16,122 --> 01:12:17,749
Owen Lars.

768
01:12:17,857 --> 01:12:20,052
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

769
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,150
I'm PadmÂ¨Â¦.

770
01:12:22,528 --> 01:12:24,928
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

771
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:27,931
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

772
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:30,430
Is my mother here?

773
01:12:30,536 --> 01:12:32,265
No, she's not.

774
01:12:33,472 --> 01:12:35,201
Cliegg Lars.

775
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:37,298
Shmi is my wife.

776
01:12:38,411 --> 01:12:41,437
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

777
01:12:49,054 --> 01:12:52,148
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

778
01:12:52,258 --> 01:12:55,159
A hunting party ofTusken Raiders.

779
01:12:56,162 --> 01:12:59,063
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

780
01:12:59,165 --> 01:13:02,532
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

781
01:13:03,235 --> 01:13:06,796
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

782
01:13:06,906 --> 01:13:08,806
when they took her.

783
01:13:10,409 --> 01:13:12,468
Those Tuskens walk like men...

784
01:13:12,578 --> 01:13:17,174
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

785
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:22,044
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

786
01:13:23,022 --> 01:13:27,152
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

787
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:32,891
I just couldn't ride anymore
until I heal.

788
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:35,734
I don't want to give up on her...

789
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:38,702
but she's been gone a month.

790
01:13:38,804 --> 01:13:41,830
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

791
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:48,580
Where are you going?

792
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:51,106
To find my mother.

793
01:13:52,318 --> 01:13:55,185
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

794
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:20,335
You're gonna have to stay here.

795
01:14:20,446 --> 01:14:23,108
These are good people, PadmÂ¨Â¦.
You'll be safe.

796
01:14:35,761 --> 01:14:37,729
I won't be long.

797
01:16:26,705 --> 01:16:28,696
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

798
01:16:28,807 --> 01:16:31,207
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

799
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:34,108
What about the senator
from Naboo?

800
01:16:34,747 --> 01:16:36,772
Is she dead yet?

801
01:16:37,483 --> 01:16:41,442
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

802
01:16:41,553 --> 01:16:43,851
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

803
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:47,016
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

804
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:50,289
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

805
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,140
As I explained to you earlier...

806
01:17:03,242 --> 01:17:06,473
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

807
01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:09,376
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

808
01:17:10,315 --> 01:17:13,250
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

809
01:17:14,186 --> 01:17:15,915
The Techno Union army...

810
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:21,922
is at your disposal, Count.

811
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:26,322
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

812
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:28,297
Good. Very good.

813
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:32,836
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

814
01:17:33,205 --> 01:17:35,833
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

815
01:17:35,941 --> 01:17:38,967
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

816
01:17:39,812 --> 01:17:42,508
TheJedi will be overwhelmed.

817
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:47,416
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

818
01:18:48,247 --> 01:18:50,238
Mom?

819
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:54,652
Ani?

820
01:18:55,888 --> 01:18:57,685
Ani?

821
01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:00,585
Is it you?

822
01:19:00,692 --> 01:19:04,253
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

823
01:19:10,636 --> 01:19:13,605
You look so handsome.

824
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,135
My son.

825
01:19:19,244 --> 01:19:22,008
My grown-up son.

826
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:25,813
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

827
01:19:25,918 --> 01:19:27,852
I missed you.

828
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:32,682
Now I am complete.

829
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,722
I love y...

830
01:19:42,935 --> 01:19:46,063
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

831
01:19:46,171 --> 01:19:48,230
I love...

832
01:19:49,775 --> 01:19:52,243
I love...

833
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:51,359
Anakin!

834
01:20:51,904 --> 01:20:53,371
No!

835
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:15,386
What is it?

836
01:21:16,495 --> 01:21:19,953
Pain, suffering...

837
01:21:20,532 --> 01:21:22,523
death I feel.

838
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:30,200
Something terrible has happened.

839
01:21:32,878 --> 01:21:35,904
Young Skywalker is in pain...

840
01:21:36,014 --> 01:21:37,879
terrible pain.

841
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:46,317
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

842
01:21:46,425 --> 01:21:49,155
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

843
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:52,720
We'll have to try something else.

844
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:58,432
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

845
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,431
It's much closer.

846
01:22:02,274 --> 01:22:04,572
Anakin, do you copy?

847
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,679
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

848
01:22:07,779 --> 01:22:10,111
He's not on Naboo, R4.

849
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,845
I'm going to try and widen the range.

850
01:22:17,255 --> 01:22:19,223
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

851
01:22:26,732 --> 01:22:28,597
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

852
01:22:28,734 --> 01:22:31,202
but it's coming from Tatooine.

853
01:22:32,771 --> 01:22:35,365
What in the blazes is he doing there?

854
01:22:35,474 --> 01:22:37,442
I told him to stay on Naboo.

855
01:22:40,946 --> 01:22:42,641
We haven't got much time.

856
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:44,807
Anakin, do you copy?

857
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,941
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

858
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,794
Retransmit this message...

859
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:01,526
Anakin, do you copy?

860
01:23:01,633 --> 01:23:03,999
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

861
01:23:04,102 --> 01:23:06,434
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

862
01:23:50,982 --> 01:23:52,973
I brought you something.

863
01:23:53,085 --> 01:23:55,212
Are you hungry?

864
01:23:56,988 --> 01:23:58,956
The shifter broke.

865
01:24:00,826 --> 01:24:03,624
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

866
01:24:06,064 --> 01:24:09,556
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

867
01:24:11,903 --> 01:24:13,871
But I couldn't...

868
01:24:17,876 --> 01:24:19,810
Why'd she have to die?

869
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:25,374
Why couldn't I save her?

870
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:27,542
I know I could have!

871
01:24:30,388 --> 01:24:32,913
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

872
01:24:34,593 --> 01:24:37,255
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

873
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:42,022
Someday I will be.

874
01:24:42,367 --> 01:24:44,995
I will be the most powerfulJedi ever.

875
01:24:46,705 --> 01:24:48,730
I promise you.

876
01:24:49,474 --> 01:24:51,840
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

877
01:24:55,614 --> 01:24:59,607
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

878
01:24:59,718 --> 01:25:01,743
He's holding me back!

879
01:25:06,124 --> 01:25:08,183
What's wrong, Ani?

880
01:25:18,937 --> 01:25:20,905
I killed them.

881
01:25:22,641 --> 01:25:24,609
I killed them all.

882
01:25:26,444 --> 01:25:28,344
They're dead.

883
01:25:28,446 --> 01:25:30,539
Every single one of them.

884
01:25:32,684 --> 01:25:34,652
And not just the men...

885
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:38,647
but the women...

886
01:25:38,757 --> 01:25:40,657
and the children too.

887
01:25:41,626 --> 01:25:43,685
They're like animals...

888
01:25:43,795 --> 01:25:46,127
and I slaughtered them like animals!

889
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:49,757
I hate them!

890
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,587
To be angry is to be human.

891
01:26:09,688 --> 01:26:11,588
I'm a Jedi.

892
01:26:12,691 --> 01:26:14,591
I know I'm better than this.

893
01:26:28,573 --> 01:26:33,101
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

894
01:26:33,211 --> 01:26:38,342
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

895
01:26:41,319 --> 01:26:43,344
Good-bye, my darling wife.

896
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:49,293
And thank you.

897
01:27:16,588 --> 01:27:18,852
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

898
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:23,224
I wasn't strong enough.

899
01:27:27,799 --> 01:27:31,166
But I promise I won't fail again.

900
01:27:42,113 --> 01:27:44,172
I miss you...

901
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,450
so much.

902
01:27:54,392 --> 01:27:57,088
R2? What are you doing here?

903
01:27:59,998 --> 01:28:04,230
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

904
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:08,364
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

905
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:12,976
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

906
01:28:13,078 --> 01:28:15,308
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.

907
01:28:19,818 --> 01:28:22,048
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

908
01:28:22,153 --> 01:28:24,314
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

909
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:28,051
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

910
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,150
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

911
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:33,753
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

912
01:28:33,865 --> 01:28:36,026
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

913
01:28:36,134 --> 01:28:39,797
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...

914
01:28:39,938 --> 01:28:41,963
Wait.

915
01:28:52,817 --> 01:28:57,447
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

916
01:28:57,555 --> 01:28:59,318
I agree.

917
01:29:00,725 --> 01:29:03,023
We will deal with Count Dooku.

918
01:29:03,128 --> 01:29:06,689
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

919
01:29:06,798 --> 01:29:09,528
Protect the senator at all costs.

920
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:12,159
That is your first priority.

921
01:29:13,605 --> 01:29:15,573
Understood, Master.

922
01:29:15,673 --> 01:29:17,607
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

923
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:20,940
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

924
01:29:23,148 --> 01:29:25,241
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

925
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,318
If he's still alive.

926
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,882
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

927
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:34,481
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

928
01:29:35,693 --> 01:29:39,390
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

929
01:29:39,497 --> 01:29:42,728
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

930
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:45,029
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

931
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:49,965
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

932
01:29:54,012 --> 01:29:57,175
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

933
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:10,428
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

934
01:30:10,528 --> 01:30:12,496
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

935
01:30:12,597 --> 01:30:15,998
The debate is over.

936
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:19,092
Now we need that clone army.

937
01:30:19,204 --> 01:30:22,139
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

938
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,674
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

939
01:30:24,776 --> 01:30:26,539
before the separatists attack.

940
01:30:26,644 --> 01:30:28,544
This is a crisis.

941
01:30:28,646 --> 01:30:31,774
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

942
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:34,943
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

943
01:30:35,286 --> 01:30:37,481
But what senator would have
the courage...

944
01:30:37,589 --> 01:30:40,149
to propose such a radical amendment?

945
01:30:40,258 --> 01:30:44,354
If only Senator Amidala were here.

946
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,581
Traitor.

947
01:31:08,086 --> 01:31:11,249
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

948
01:31:11,356 --> 01:31:13,415
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

949
01:31:13,525 --> 01:31:16,153
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

950
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:18,855
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

951
01:31:18,963 --> 01:31:22,399
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

952
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,163
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

953
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:30,071
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

954
01:31:30,174 --> 01:31:32,608
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

955
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:35,611
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

956
01:31:35,713 --> 01:31:37,374
Do you know him?

957
01:31:37,482 --> 01:31:40,280
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

958
01:31:40,385 --> 01:31:42,353
The Geonosians don't trust them.

959
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:45,320
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

960
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:50,621
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

961
01:31:51,296 --> 01:31:53,764
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

962
01:31:58,636 --> 01:32:00,661
I wish he were still alive.

963
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,836
I could use his help right now.

964
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:08,178
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

965
01:32:09,981 --> 01:32:12,882
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

966
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:15,544
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

967
01:32:15,653 --> 01:32:17,678
just as you were once his.

968
01:32:18,656 --> 01:32:20,851
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

969
01:32:20,959 --> 01:32:23,985
but he wouldn't have gone along with it
if he had learned the truth as I have.

970
01:32:24,095 --> 01:32:26,859
- The truth?
- The truth.

971
01:32:33,271 --> 01:32:36,570
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

972
01:32:36,674 --> 01:32:38,767
of the dark lord of the Sith?

973
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:41,709
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

974
01:32:41,846 --> 01:32:46,078
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

975
01:32:47,218 --> 01:32:49,778
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

976
01:32:49,887 --> 01:32:54,483
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

977
01:32:55,593 --> 01:32:57,185
I don't believe you.

978
01:32:57,295 --> 01:32:59,661
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

979
01:32:59,764 --> 01:33:02,995
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

980
01:33:03,868 --> 01:33:07,702
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

981
01:33:07,805 --> 01:33:10,899
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

982
01:33:12,944 --> 01:33:15,003
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

983
01:33:16,214 --> 01:33:20,173
and together we will destroy the Sith!

984
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:24,217
I will never join you, Dooku.

985
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:36,632
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

986
01:33:44,277 --> 01:33:47,178
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

987
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,942
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

988
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:54,350
Senators, "dellow felagates":

989
01:33:54,454 --> 01:33:58,481
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

990
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:02,289
mesa propose that the senate...

991
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:06,024
give immediately emergency powers...

992
01:34:06,132 --> 01:34:08,760
to the supreme chancellor.

993
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:14,966
Palpatine! Palpatine!

994
01:34:18,078 --> 01:34:21,309
Order! We shall have order!

995
01:34:23,016 --> 01:34:26,349
It is with great reluctance...

996
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:28,546
that I have agreed to this calling.

997
01:34:29,923 --> 01:34:33,882
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

998
01:34:34,728 --> 01:34:36,923
The power you give me...

999
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:41,558
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1000
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:50,874
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1001
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:55,380
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1002
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:59,248
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1003
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,485
It is done, then.

1004
01:35:07,794 --> 01:35:11,457
I will take whatJedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1005
01:35:11,565 --> 01:35:15,467
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1006
01:35:16,503 --> 01:35:20,200
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1007
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,885
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1008
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:45,054
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1009
01:35:45,932 --> 01:35:47,900
That'll do.

1010
01:35:57,377 --> 01:36:00,312
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1011
01:36:00,413 --> 01:36:02,506
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1012
01:36:02,616 --> 01:36:04,277
As a member of the senate...

1013
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:07,478
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1014
01:36:07,854 --> 01:36:09,822
Don't worry.

1015
01:36:09,923 --> 01:36:12,357
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1016
01:36:17,097 --> 01:36:20,328
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1017
01:36:20,433 --> 01:36:22,333
they would have asked for it.

1018
01:36:22,435 --> 01:36:25,563
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

1019
01:36:51,464 --> 01:36:54,627
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1020
01:36:56,736 --> 01:36:59,296
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1021
01:37:02,909 --> 01:37:04,809
"What does that mean?"

1022
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:07,641
That means I am in charge here!

1023
01:37:07,747 --> 01:37:09,374
Where are you going now?

1024
01:37:09,482 --> 01:37:12,974
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1025
01:37:13,353 --> 01:37:15,048
Idiot!

1026
01:37:17,257 --> 01:37:18,986
Please wait.

1027
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:21,727
Do you know where you're going?

1028
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,967
Wait.

1029
01:38:51,751 --> 01:38:53,480
Oh, my goodness!

1030
01:38:53,586 --> 01:38:55,144
Shut me down!

1031
01:38:56,256 --> 01:38:58,247
Machines making machines.

1032
01:38:58,358 --> 01:38:59,825
How perverse!

1033
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,193
Calm down, R2!

1034
01:39:02,295 --> 01:39:04,786
I almost fell.

1035
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:06,866
You'll get your chance...

1036
01:39:08,868 --> 01:39:10,699
I'm scrap.

1037
01:39:11,771 --> 01:39:14,171
It's a nightmare!

1038
01:39:15,942 --> 01:39:17,910
I want to go home!

1039
01:39:19,445 --> 01:39:21,345
What did I do to deserve this?

1040
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,482
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1041
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:05,990
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1042
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,952
Oh, no!

1043
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:19,998
Uh-oh.

1044
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:25,611
I'm so confused.

1045
01:42:21,494 --> 01:42:23,359
Not again!

1046
01:42:23,663 --> 01:42:25,631
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1047
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:36,207
Don't move, Jedi!

1048
01:42:36,309 --> 01:42:37,799
Take him away.

1049
01:42:56,829 --> 01:42:58,660
Don't be afraid.

1050
01:43:00,433 --> 01:43:02,424
I'm not afraid to die.

1051
01:43:07,273 --> 01:43:11,403
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1052
01:43:12,678 --> 01:43:15,238
What are you talking about?

1053
01:43:16,716 --> 01:43:18,775
I love you.

1054
01:43:22,555 --> 01:43:24,523
You love me?

1055
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:32,260
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1056
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,992
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1057
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:40,862
and that it would destroy our lives.

1058
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:44,032
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1059
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:51,013
I truly...

1060
01:43:52,018 --> 01:43:54,452
deeply love you...

1061
01:43:55,655 --> 01:43:58,215
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1062
01:44:55,381 --> 01:44:58,009
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1063
01:44:58,117 --> 01:45:01,177
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1064
01:45:03,556 --> 01:45:05,421
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1065
01:45:06,392 --> 01:45:07,916
Good job.

1066
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:23,299
Settle down. Settle down.

1067
01:45:27,313 --> 01:45:31,044
Let the executions begin.

1068
01:46:03,883 --> 01:46:06,818
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1069
01:46:32,412 --> 01:46:34,880
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about PadmÂ¨Â¦?

1070
01:46:34,981 --> 01:46:37,108
She seems to be on top of things.

1071
01:47:40,113 --> 01:47:41,842
She can't do that!

1072
01:47:41,948 --> 01:47:43,848
Shoot her... or something!

1073
01:49:02,695 --> 01:49:04,094
Jump!

1074
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:31,282
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1075
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:33,518
Jango! Finish her off!

1076
01:49:33,626 --> 01:49:36,857
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1077
01:50:07,693 --> 01:50:09,160
Master Windu.

1078
01:50:09,262 --> 01:50:11,594
How pleasant of you to join us.

1079
01:50:11,697 --> 01:50:13,722
This party's over.

1080
01:50:27,313 --> 01:50:29,577
Brave...

1081
01:50:29,682 --> 01:50:32,048
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1082
01:50:32,151 --> 01:50:34,016
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1083
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,452
I don't think so.

1084
01:50:36,556 --> 01:50:37,989
We'll see.

1085
01:51:16,729 --> 01:51:19,323
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1086
01:51:59,071 --> 01:52:01,539
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1087
01:52:01,641 --> 01:52:03,836
There's been some terrible mistake!

1088
01:52:03,943 --> 01:52:06,673
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1089
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,065
Die, Jedi dogs!

1090
01:53:36,168 --> 01:53:37,931
Oh! What did I say?

1091
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:50,311
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1092
01:53:55,988 --> 01:53:58,889
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1093
01:54:12,838 --> 01:54:16,865
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1094
01:54:22,014 --> 01:54:23,982
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1095
01:54:42,134 --> 01:54:44,398
R2, what are you doing here?

1096
01:54:47,606 --> 01:54:48,937
What are you doing?

1097
01:54:49,074 --> 01:54:51,702
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1098
01:54:51,811 --> 01:54:53,574
My neck!

1099
01:54:55,881 --> 01:54:58,907
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1100
01:55:03,923 --> 01:55:05,948
I'm quite beside myself.

1101
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:17,898
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1102
01:55:19,338 --> 01:55:21,863
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1103
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:46,257
Master Windu...

1104
01:55:46,365 --> 01:55:48,595
you have fought gallantly...

1105
01:55:49,768 --> 01:55:53,795
worthy of recognition
in the archives of theJedi order.

1106
01:55:55,774 --> 01:55:57,071
Now...

1107
01:55:58,043 --> 01:56:00,443
it is finished.

1108
01:56:00,546 --> 01:56:02,537
Surrender...

1109
01:56:02,648 --> 01:56:05,344
and your lives will be spared.

1110
01:56:06,218 --> 01:56:09,346
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1111
01:56:09,455 --> 01:56:10,479
Then...

1112
01:56:11,957 --> 01:56:14,016
I'm sorry, old friend.

1113
01:56:24,703 --> 01:56:26,136
Look!

1114
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:42,109
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1115
01:57:38,644 --> 01:57:41,670
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1116
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:54,282
If Dooku escapes...

1117
01:57:54,393 --> 01:57:58,090
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1118
01:58:02,634 --> 01:58:04,465
Hold on!

1119
01:58:09,008 --> 01:58:10,976
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1120
01:58:17,316 --> 01:58:19,580
Good call, my young Padawan.

1121
01:58:33,832 --> 01:58:36,164
TheJedi have amassed a huge army.

1122
01:58:36,268 --> 01:58:38,327
That doesn't seem possible.

1123
01:58:38,437 --> 01:58:41,133
How could theJedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1124
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,676
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1125
01:58:44,777 --> 01:58:46,677
There are too many.

1126
01:58:47,646 --> 01:58:50,410
Our communications have been jammed.

1127
01:58:58,624 --> 01:59:01,525
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1128
01:59:01,627 --> 01:59:02,958
Yes, sir.

1129
01:59:11,036 --> 01:59:12,298
Sir...

1130
01:59:12,404 --> 01:59:15,032
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1131
01:59:16,041 --> 01:59:19,340
To the forward command center
take me.

1132
01:59:42,668 --> 01:59:45,398
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1133
01:59:56,381 --> 02:00:00,181
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1134
02:00:00,285 --> 02:00:02,150
Very good.

1135
02:00:02,788 --> 02:00:04,415
Very good.

1136
02:00:32,618 --> 02:00:34,711
This is not looking good at all!

1137
02:00:35,988 --> 02:00:39,253
We must get the starships
back into space.

1138
02:00:42,294 --> 02:00:46,230
We have to order a retreat.

1139
02:00:46,331 --> 02:00:48,697
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1140
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,132
to get away with this treachery.

1141
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:54,501
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1142
02:00:54,606 --> 02:00:58,633
TheJedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1143
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:06,381
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1144
02:01:09,621 --> 02:01:12,055
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1145
02:01:12,991 --> 02:01:15,721
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1146
02:02:10,249 --> 02:02:15,050
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1147
02:02:15,153 --> 02:02:16,984
Yes, sir.

1148
02:02:17,089 --> 02:02:20,547
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1149
02:03:00,699 --> 02:03:02,166
Look over there!

1150
02:03:05,637 --> 02:03:08,037
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1151
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:10,040
We're out of rockets, sir.

1152
02:03:10,142 --> 02:03:13,009
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1153
02:03:13,111 --> 02:03:17,172
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1154
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:43,233
Put the ship down!

1155
02:03:43,342 --> 02:03:45,242
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1156
02:03:45,344 --> 02:03:47,107
Follow that speeder!

1157
02:03:53,185 --> 02:03:55,551
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1158
02:03:55,654 --> 02:03:59,146
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1159
02:03:59,257 --> 02:04:02,249
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1160
02:04:02,361 --> 02:04:04,659
You will be expelled
from theJedi order!

1161
02:04:04,763 --> 02:04:07,994
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1162
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:10,728
What do you think PadmÂ¨Â¦ would do
were she in your position?

1163
02:04:15,374 --> 02:04:17,399
She would do her duty.

1164
02:04:26,385 --> 02:04:28,444
The droid army is in full retreat.

1165
02:04:28,553 --> 02:04:31,647
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1166
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:01,778
You're gonna pay for all theJedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1167
02:05:01,887 --> 02:05:03,582
We'll take him together.

1168
02:05:03,688 --> 02:05:05,656
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1169
02:05:13,832 --> 02:05:17,324
As you see, myJedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1170
02:05:17,436 --> 02:05:19,370
Now... back down.

1171
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:27,041
I don't think so.

1172
02:05:39,357 --> 02:05:42,588
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1173
02:05:42,694 --> 02:05:45,754
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1174
02:05:48,133 --> 02:05:50,567
Surely you can do better.

1175
02:06:01,746 --> 02:06:03,646
Are you all right?

1176
02:06:03,748 --> 02:06:05,409
Uh-huh.

1177
02:06:06,051 --> 02:06:08,315
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

1178
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:10,012
No.

1179
02:06:10,121 --> 02:06:13,648
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1180
02:06:13,758 --> 02:06:15,726
Get a transport. Hurry!

1181
02:06:15,827 --> 02:06:16,885
Right away.

1182
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:43,885
Brave of you, boy.

1183
02:06:45,156 --> 02:06:47,386
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1184
02:06:47,492 --> 02:06:49,084
I am a slow learner.

1185
02:07:51,556 --> 02:07:53,319
Master Yoda.

1186
02:07:53,425 --> 02:07:56,485
Count Dooku.

1187
02:07:56,595 --> 02:07:59,962
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1188
02:08:31,262 --> 02:08:34,197
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1189
02:08:34,699 --> 02:08:37,793
The dark side I sense in you.

1190
02:08:37,902 --> 02:08:40,700
I've become more powerful
than anyJedi.

1191
02:08:41,806 --> 02:08:43,433
Even you.

1192
02:08:58,823 --> 02:09:01,883
Much to learn you still have.

1193
02:09:01,993 --> 02:09:05,190
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1194
02:09:05,296 --> 02:09:07,560
by our knowledge of the Force...

1195
02:09:09,601 --> 02:09:12,195
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1196
02:09:53,445 --> 02:09:57,211
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1197
02:09:57,315 --> 02:09:59,078
This is just the beginning.

1198
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:34,738
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1199
02:12:34,839 --> 02:12:37,808
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1200
02:12:39,677 --> 02:12:42,009
You have done well.

1201
02:12:42,113 --> 02:12:44,479
I have good news for you, my lord.

1202
02:12:45,984 --> 02:12:49,010
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1203
02:12:49,621 --> 02:12:52,317
Everything is going as planned.

1204
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:06,259
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1205
02:13:06,804 --> 02:13:08,795
It doesn't feel right.

1206
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:12,109
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1207
02:13:13,411 --> 02:13:15,140
Lies, deceit...

1208
02:13:15,246 --> 02:13:19,046
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1209
02:13:19,150 --> 02:13:20,583
Nevertheless...

1210
02:13:20,685 --> 02:13:23,711
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1211
02:13:23,821 --> 02:13:25,846
I agree.

1212
02:13:26,991 --> 02:13:28,856
Where is your apprentice?

1213
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,862
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1214
02:13:34,666 --> 02:13:38,295
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1215
02:13:38,403 --> 02:13:40,462
Victory?

1216
02:13:41,339 --> 02:13:43,739
Victory, you say?

1217
02:13:43,841 --> 02:13:47,538
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1218
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:52,311
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1219
02:13:53,651 --> 02:13:57,485
