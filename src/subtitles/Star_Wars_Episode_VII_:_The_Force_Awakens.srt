ï»¿1
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,854
This will begin to make things right.

2
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,767
I've traveled too far and seen too much

3
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,819
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

4
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,782
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

5
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,156
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

6
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,028
The General's been after this
for a long time.

7
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,909
Oh, the General?

8
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,366
To me, she is royalty.

9
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,376
Well, she certainly is that.

10
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,379
We got company.

11
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,977
You have to hide.

12
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,520
You have to leave.

13
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,644
Go.

14
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,353
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

15
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,733
<i>STORMTROOPER'. Blast that X-Wing!</i>

16
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,988
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

17
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,125
I see them.

18
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,698
You take this.

19
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,742
It's safer with you than it is with me.

20
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,696
You get as far away from here
as you can.

21
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,581
Do you hear me?

22
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,075
I'll come back for you.

23
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,119
Itwill be all right.

24
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,474
Keep moving!

25
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,982
Stay here.

26
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,251
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

27
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,888
Something far worse
has happened to you.

28
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,673
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

29
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,972
I know where you come from.

30
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,019
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

31
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,106
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

32
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,019
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

33
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,613
The First Order rose from the dark side.

34
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,689
You did not.

35
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,360
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

36
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,700
You may try.

37
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,784
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

38
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,580
<i>You're so right.</i>

39
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,908
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

40
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,949
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

41
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,709
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

42
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,411
- Search him.
-...apparatus.

43
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,333
<i>- Nothing, sir.
- Put him on board.</i>

44
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,967
<i>PHASMA". Sir, the villagers?</i>

45
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,770
<i>- Kill them all.</i>

46
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,857
<i>On my command.</i>

47
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,185
<i>Fire.</i>

48
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,270
Please, no!

49
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,555
Nothing here.
Go ahead!

50
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,683
All right.

51
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,760
All right!

52
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,379
<i>PHASMA'. FN-2187.</i>

53
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

54
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,460
Yes, Captain.

55
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,720
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

56
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,381
I'm sorry, Captain.

57
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,558
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

58
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,511
What you brought
me today is worth...

59
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,308
hmm...

60
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,354
one quarter portion.

61
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,011
Shh.

62
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,352
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

63
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,650
He has no respect for anyone.

64
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,446
Your antenna's bent.

65
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,245
Where do you come from?

66
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,834
Classified, really?

67
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,210
Me too. Big secret.

68
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,219
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

69
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,175
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

70
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,759
You'll drown in the sand.

71
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,973
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

72
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,185
No!

73
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,203
In the morning, you go.

74
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,126
You're welcome.

75
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,098
<i>I had no idea we had...</i>

76
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,934
<i>the best pilot in
the Resistance on board.</i>

77
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,354
<i>Comfortable?</i>

78
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,939
Not really.

79
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,695
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

80
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,912
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

81
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,492
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

82
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,335
You might want to rethink
your technique.

83
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,145
<i>POE GRUNTS)
- Where is it?</i>

84
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,724
The Resistance...

85
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,809
will not be intimidated by you.

86
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,779
<i>Where... is it?</i>

87
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,495
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

88
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,048
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

89
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,796
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

90
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,630
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

91
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,841
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

92
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,391
Classified.

93
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,140
I know all about waiting.

94
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,184
For my family.

95
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,601
They'll be back. One day.

96
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,394
Come on.

97
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,571
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

98
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,529
Let me see here... hmm...

99
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,622
one half portion.

100
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,416
Last week they were a half portion each.

101
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,206
What about the droid?

102
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,085
What about him?

103
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,378
I'll pay for him.

104
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,553
Sixty portions.

105
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,562
Actually...

106
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,487
The droid's not for sale.

107
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Come on.

108
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,493
Follow the girl and get that droid.

109
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,798
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

110
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,300
<i>FN-2187". Turn here.</i>

111
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,261
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

112
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,598
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

113
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,682
What?

114
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,027
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

115
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,854
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

116
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:48,984
You're with the Resistance?

117
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,028
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

118
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,109
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

119
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,453
Why? Why are you helping me?

120
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,540
Because it's the right thing to do.

121
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,496
You need a pilot.

122
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,960
I need a pilot.

123
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,545
We're gonna do this.

124
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,872
Yeah?

125
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,387
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

126
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,965
- I <i>am calm.
- I'm talking to myself.</i>

127
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,468
<i>Not yet.</i>

128
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,063
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

129
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,405
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

130
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,574
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

131
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,992
Okay, same principle.

132
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,068
Use the toggle on the left...

133
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,825
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

134
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,367
Use the sight on the right to aim.

135
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,578
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

136
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,256
I can fix this.

137
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,088
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

138
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,924
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

139
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,703
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

140
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,873
<i>I</i> got it.

141
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,333
This thing really moves.

142
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,090
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

143
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,299
or we're not gonna get very far.

144
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,800
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

145
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,881
Just stay sharp.

146
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,685
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

147
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,808
I got us dead center.

148
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,013
-It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

149
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,194
- Yeah!
- Yes!

150
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,365
Did you see that?

151
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,068
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

152
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,866
Hey, what's your name?

153
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,202
FN-2187.

154
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,501
F... What?

155
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,420
That's the only name they ever gave me.

156
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,007
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

157
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,584
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

158
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,294
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

159
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,050
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

160
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,301
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

161
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,304
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

162
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,309
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

163
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,475
Use the ventral cannons.

164
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,731
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

165
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,529
<i>KYLO REN". General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

166
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,027
Yes, and he had help...

167
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,484
from one of our own.

168
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,493
We're checking the registers now...

169
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,487
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

170
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,991
<i>The one from the village. FN-2187.</i>

171
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,414
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

172
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,953
Fire.

173
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,010
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

174
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,841
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

175
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:04,967
I see him!

176
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,847
Nice shot!

177
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,278
Where are we going?

178
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,522
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

179
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,194
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

180
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,742
We need to get out of this system.

181
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,694
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

182
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,071
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

183
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,373
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

184
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't care what color he is!

185
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,826
No droid can be that important.

186
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,910
This one is, pal!

187
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,666
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

188
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,083
We go back to Jakku, we die.

189
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,882
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

190
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,880
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

191
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,057
<i>FN-2187 reported
to my division...</i>

192
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,472
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

193
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,804
No prior signs of nonconformity?

194
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,810
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

195
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,015
General!

196
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,475
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

197
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,810
Disabled.

198
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,315
They were headed back to Jakku.

199
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,613
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

200
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,361
They were going back for the droid.

201
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,405
Send a squad to the wreckage.

202
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,928
Poe!

203
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,555
POeI

204
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,433
POeI

205
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,392
Poe! I got you.

206
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
POeI

207
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,449
POeI

208
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,872
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

209
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,454
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

210
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,331
<i>KYLO REN". How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

211
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,920
I won't have you question my methods.

212
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,043
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

213
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,963
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

214
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,131
My men are exceptionally trained.

215
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,427
Programmed from birth.

216
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,801
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

217
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,881
<i>Unharmed.</i>

218
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,138
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

219
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,687
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

220
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,268
<i>I want that map.</i>

221
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,725
<i>For your sake...</i>

222
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,066
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

223
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,821
Water. Water.

224
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,947
No water.

225
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,528
Water.

226
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,496
ls there water?

227
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,278
What? Oi, get off him!

228
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,738
Hey!

229
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,178
They work for Unkar.

230
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,051
That guy that wanted you.

231
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,761
He must have really wanted you.

232
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,015
REYI Who?

233
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,105
Him?

234
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:28,086
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

235
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,716
- Ow!

236
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,088
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

237
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,670
This droid says you stole it.

238
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,302
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

239
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,514
So I'd appreciate it...

240
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,849
if you stop accusing me of...

241
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,389
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

242
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,812
It belongs to his master.

243
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,193
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

244
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,857
He was captured by the First Order.

245
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,575
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

246
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,821
Poe didn't make it.

247
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,833
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

248
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,721
So you're with the Resistance?

249
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,686
Obviously.

250
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,141
Yes, I am.

251
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,518
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

252
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,687
I am with the Resistance.

253
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,315
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

254
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,322
Well, this is what we look like.

255
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,947
Some of us. Others look different.

256
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,493
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

257
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,070
He has to get back to your base.

258
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,448
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

259
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,204
and everyone's after it.

260
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,543
Luke Skywalker?

261
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,579
I thought he was a myth.

262
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,881
What?

263
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,427
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

264
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,889
Come on, BB-8!

265
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,723
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

266
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,942
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

267
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,317
BB-8, stay close!

268
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,397
This way.

269
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,411
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

270
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,785
Come on!

271
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,458
They're shooting at both of us.

272
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,453
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

273
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,000
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

274
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,922
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

275
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,709
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

276
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,339
Are you okay?

277
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,305
Stop taking my hand!

278
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,610
Hey-

279
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:05,952
Are you okay?

280
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah.

281
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,744
Follow me.

282
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,549
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

283
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,929
in that quadjumper!

284
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,351
Hey, we need a pilot!

285
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,015
We've got one.

286
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
You?

287
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,773
Uh, what about that ship?

288
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,316
That one's garbage!

289
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,282
The garbage will do.

290
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,882
Gunner position is down there!

291
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,755
You ever fly this thing?

292
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,008
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

293
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,175
Great.

294
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,605
Whoa.

295
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,816
I can do this. I can do this.

296
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,852
I can do this. I can do this.

297
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,040
Hey!

298
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,925
That's mine!

299
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,101
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

300
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,310
- What?
- Stay <i>low!</i>

301
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,603
It confuses their tracking.

302
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,894
BB-8, hold on!

303
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,433
I'm going low!

304
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,293
What are you doing back there?

305
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,583
Are you ever gonna fire back?

306
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,794
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

307
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,588
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

308
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,627
Try sitting in this thing.

309
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,276
We need cover, quick!

310
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,731
We're about to get some!

311
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,027
<i>I</i> hope.

312
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,214
Damn it!

313
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,981
Come on, come on!

314
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,066
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

315
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,706
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

316
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,462
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

317
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,839
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

318
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,770
Are we really doing this?

319
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,539
Oh, no.

320
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,970
Whoo!

321
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,862
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

322
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:55,945
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

323
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,326
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

324
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,157
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

325
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,412
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

326
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,835
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

327
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,287
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

328
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,917
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

329
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,920
He's gonna get you home.

330
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,047
We both will.

331
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,012
I don't know your name.

332
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,519
Finn. What's yours?

333
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,106
I'm Rey.

334
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:32,991
Rey...

335
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,906
Help me with this. Quick!

336
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,362
Whoa, what's going on?

337
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,795
Sir...

338
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,502
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

339
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,135
It escaped capture...

340
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,808
aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

341
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,437
<i>The droid...</i>

342
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,139
<i>stole a freighter?</i>

343
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,641
Not exactly, sir.

344
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,308
It had help.

345
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,029
We have no confirmation...

346
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,525
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

347
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:33,877
<i>Anything else?</i>

348
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,177
The two were accompanied by a girl.

349
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,347
<i>What girl?</i>

350
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,149
It's the motivator.

351
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,727
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

352
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,811
How bad is it?

353
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,568
If we wanna live, not good.

354
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,655
They're hunting for us now.

355
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:55,903
We've gotta get out of this system!

356
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,526
BB-8 said the location
of the Resistance base...

357
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,739
is "need to know".

358
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,487
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

359
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,571
This?

360
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,449
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

361
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,168
I don't speak that.

362
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,995
All right, between us...

363
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,546
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

364
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,132
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

365
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,960
But you tell us where the base is...

366
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,465
I'll get you there first. Deal?

367
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,048
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

368
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,801
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

369
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,013
Please.

370
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,934
- The lleenium system?
- Yeah, the lleenium system.

371
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,686
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

372
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,404
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

373
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,654
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

374
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,822
What about you?

375
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,115
I gotta get back to Jakku.

376
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,200
Back to Jak...

377
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,743
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

378
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,413
-It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

379
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,407
The one I'm pointing to. No.

380
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,787
No. No!

381
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,251
If we don't patch it up...

382
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,456
the propulsion tank will overflow...

383
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,209
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

384
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,288
- This?
- Yes.

385
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,509
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

386
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,507
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

387
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,883
You got a family?

388
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,089
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

389
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,682
None of your business, that's why.

390
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,470
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

391
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,434
Someone's locked on to us.

392
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,107
All controls are overridden.

393
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,619
Get off! Get off!

394
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,364
See anything?

395
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,825
Oh, no.

396
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,084
It's the First Order.

397
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,965
What do we do?
There must be something.

398
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,426
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

399
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,506
Can you unfix it?

400
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,305
Come on, BB-8.

401
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,932
I got him.

402
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,019
I'm okay.

403
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,400
BB-8, get off me!

404
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,947
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

405
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,575
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

406
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,124
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

407
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,638
Chewie...

408
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,970
we're home.

409
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,157
Where are the others?

410
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,829
- Where's the pilot?
- I'm the <i>pilot.</i>

411
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,373
You?

412
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,416
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

413
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,914
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

414
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,161
And "that thing"
can understand you, too...

415
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,291
so watch it.

416
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,294
Come on out of there.

417
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,875
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

418
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,549
Jakku? Thatjunkyard?

419
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,845
Thank you! Junkyard.

420
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,015
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

421
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,842
Who had it? Ducain?

422
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,768
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

423
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,062
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

424
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,477
Who stole it from me!

425
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,978
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

426
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,436
just stole back the
Millennium Falcon for good.

427
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,439
<i>This</i> is <i>the Millennium Falcon?
You're Han Solo?</i>

428
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,612
I used to be.

429
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,743
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

430
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,196
No, the smuggler.

431
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,121
Wasn't he a war hero?

432
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,542
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

433
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,869
Twelve!

434
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,421
Fourteen.

435
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,933
Hey!

436
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,434
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

437
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,608
Unkar Plutt did.

438
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,061
I thought it was a mistake,
too. Puts too much...

439
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,442
...stress on the hyperdrive.

440
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,948
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

441
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,942
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

442
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,744
Wait, no.

443
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,242
- We need your help.
- My help?

444
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,868
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

445
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,245
as soon as possible.

446
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,328
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

447
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,756
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

448
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,842
You knew him.

449
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,308
Yeah. I knew him.

450
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,017
I knew Luke.

451
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,109
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

452
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:47,774
Wait, what?

453
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,364
Did you just say Rathtars?

454
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,111
Hey!

455
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,744
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

456
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,500
I'm hauling Rathtars.

457
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,795
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

458
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,338
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

459
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,253
What's a Rathtar?

460
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,834
They're big and they're dangerous.

461
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,464
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

462
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,590
- No.
- Good.

463
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,546
I got three of them going to King Prana.

464
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,974
Three? How'd you get them on board?

465
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,767
I used to have a bigger crew.

466
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,269
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

467
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,941
and don't even think about
taking the Falcon.

468
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,017
What about BB-8?

469
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,819
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

470
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,441
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

471
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,489
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

472
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,948
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

473
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,325
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

474
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,909
Yes, I do. Every time.

475
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,177
Han Solo.

476
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,729
You're a dead man.

477
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,565
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

478
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,439
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

479
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,070
- Can you see them?
- No.

480
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,233
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

481
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,568
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

482
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,658
How long we known each other?

483
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,829
They have blasters.

484
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,997
A lot of them.

485
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,293
Not long.
We want our money back now.

486
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,370
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

487
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,625
I spent that money.

488
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,128
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

489
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,547
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

490
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,503
BALA-TIKZ Tell that t0 Kanjiklub.

491
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,023
Tasu Leech.

492
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,099
Good to see you.

493
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,945
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

494
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,405
Have I ever not delivered...

495
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,989
-for you before?
- Yeah.

496
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,289
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

497
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,916
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

498
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,586
That BB unit.

499
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,513
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

500
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,306
And two fugitives.

501
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,307
First I've heard of it.

502
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,318
Wait, wait, wait.

503
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,532
If we close the blast doors
in that corridor...

504
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,779
we can trap both gangs!

505
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,330
We'll close the blast doors from here?

506
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,203
Resetting the fuses should do it.

507
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,963
I got a bad feeling about this.

508
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,170
- Oh, no.
-"Oh, no," what?

509
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,129
Wrong fuses.

510
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,385
Kill them!

511
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,723
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

512
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,376
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

513
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,590
What do they look like?

514
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,557
They look like that.

515
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,652
- This way.
- Are you sure?

516
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,735
No,no,no!

517
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,150
Finn!

518
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,243
Finn!

519
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,404
Rey!

520
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,871
Get Off! Get Off!

521
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,633
- Rey!
- Finn!

522
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,926
Finn!

523
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,259
<i>Get</i> off me!

524
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,434
FIN NI <i>Rey!</i>

525
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,358
Get off! Get off!

526
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,278
Finn!

527
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,288
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

528
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,624
I got the door. Cover us!

529
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,337
Chewie!

530
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,808
You okay?

531
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:07,968
Wow.

532
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,398
Come on! Come on!

533
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,144
Han.

534
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,481
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

535
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,406
Hey, where are you going?

536
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,162
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

537
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,039
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

538
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,331
I hate that guy.

539
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,955
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

540
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,384
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

541
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,299
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

542
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,631
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

543
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,511
<i>RAT HT AR GROW LS)
{REY YELP S';</i>

544
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,010
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

545
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,103
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

546
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,350
No problem!

547
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,525
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

548
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,036
- What?
- Compressor.

549
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,754
Inform the First Order...

550
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,673
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

551
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,750
<i>And it's</i> aboard <i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

552
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:35,056
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

553
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:40,065
leading them to the last Jedi.

554
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,025
If Skywalker returns...

555
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:49,571
the new Jedi will rise.

556
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,285
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

557
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,079
General!

558
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:59,084
Our strategy must now change.

559
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,253
The weapon. It is ready.

560
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,626
I believe the time has come to use it.

561
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,048
We shall destroy the government...

562
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,549
that supports the Resistance...

563
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,347
the Republic.

564
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,969
Without their friends to protect them...

565
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,642
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

566
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,808
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

567
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,139
Go.

568
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,353
Oversee preparations.

569
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,105
Yes, Supreme Leader.

570
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,442
There has been an awakening.

571
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,903
Have you felt it?

572
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,493
Yes.

573
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,492
There's something more.

574
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:42,211
<i>The</i> droid <i>we</i> seek <i>is</i> aboard
<i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

575
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,877
In the hands of your father...

576
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,806
Han Solo.

577
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,802
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

578
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:59,728
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

579
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:03,819
have never faced such a test.

580
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,656
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

581
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,617
We shall see.

582
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,038
We shall see.

583
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,341
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

584
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,709
Coolant's leaking.

585
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,295
Try transferring auxiliary power...

586
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,797
...to the secondary tank.

587
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,426
I got it.

588
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,217
Chewie, come on!

589
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,436
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

590
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,512
Stop moving!

591
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,354
FINNI Chewie!

592
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,192
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

593
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,654
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

594
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,031
Which is fine!

595
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,616
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

596
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,659
pieces of us in three different systems.

597
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,031
What'd you do?

598
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,996
I bypassed the compressor.

599
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,329
Huh.

600
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:07,879
Move, ball.

601
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,138
Ah, don't say that.

602
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,885
You did great. Just rest.

603
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,890
Good job, kid.

604
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,343
Thanks.

605
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,182
You're welcome.

606
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,354
HAN; So...

607
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,819
fugitives, huh?

608
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,026
The First Order wants the map.

609
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,402
Finn is with the Resistance.

610
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,446
I'm just a scavenger.

611
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,487
Let's see what you got.

612
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,457
Go ahead.

613
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,755
This map's not complete.

614
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,336
It's just a piece.

615
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,343
Ever since Luke disappeared...

616
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,466
people have been looking for him.

617
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,051
Why did he leave?

618
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,013
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

619
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,770
One boy, an apprentice...

620
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,146
turned against him, destroyed it all.

621
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,650
Luke felt responsible.

622
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,232
He just walked away from everything.

623
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,409
Do you know what happened to him?

624
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,945
A lot of rumors. Stories.

625
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,166
People that knew him best...

626
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,037
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

627
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,131
The Jedi were real?

628
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,425
I used to wonder about that myself.

629
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,719
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

630
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,180
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

631
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,384
the dark side and the light.

632
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,932
Crazy thing is...

633
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:46,770
it's true.

634
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,936
The Force. The Jedi.

635
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:54,523
All Of it.

636
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,119
It's all true.

637
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,492
No, you rest.

638
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,369
You want my help? You're getting it.

639
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,501
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

640
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,132
This is our stop.

641
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,018
I didn't know there was
this much green...

642
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,398
in the whole galaxy.

643
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,428
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

644
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,176
Did you just call me Solo?

645
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,886
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

646
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,061
You should know...

647
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,515
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

648
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,942
Which puts a real target on my back.

649
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,652
Are there any conspirators here?

650
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,604
Like, First Order sympathizers?

651
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,403
Listen, Big Deal.

652
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,405
You got another problem.

653
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,657
Women always figure out the truth.

654
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,581
Always.

655
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,955
You might need this.

656
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,921
I think I can handle myself.

657
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,169
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

658
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,253
Take it.

659
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,261
You know how to use one of those?

660
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,013
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

661
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,935
Little bit more to it than that.

662
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,100
You got a lot to learn.

663
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,766
You got a name?

664
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,684
<i>REY -</i>

665
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,394
<i>REY -</i>

666
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,696
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

667
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,743
A second mate. Someone to help out.

668
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,446
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

669
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,122
appreciates the Falcon.

670
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,037
Are you offering me a job?

671
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,619
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

672
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,586
You're offering me a job.

673
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,290
I'm thinking about it.

674
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,132
Well?

675
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,306
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

676
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,721
Where, Jakku?

677
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,103
I've already been away too long.

678
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,186
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

679
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,822
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

680
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,577
Solo, why are we here again?

681
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,199
To get your droid on a clean ship.

682
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,291
Clean?

683
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,245
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

684
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,459
If we can find it on our scanners...

685
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,882
the First Order's not far behind.

686
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,798
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

687
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,720
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

688
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,090
We can trust her, right?

689
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,720
Relax, kid.

690
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,515
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

691
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,309
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

692
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,765
so let me do the talking.

693
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,600
And whatever you do, don't stare.

694
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,730
At what?

695
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,861
Any of it.

696
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,043
Han Solo!

697
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,466
Oh, boy.

698
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,762
Hey, Maz.

699
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,563
Where's my boyfriend?

700
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,683
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

701
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:58,767
I like that Wookiee.

702
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,527
I assume you need something.

703
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,025
Desperately.

704
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,106
Let's get to it.

705
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,128
<i>KYLO REN". Forgive me.</i>

706
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,462
<i>I feel it again.</i>

707
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,675
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

708
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,010
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

709
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,471
<i>Show me again.</i>

710
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,144
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

711
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,027
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

712
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,355
<i>Show me...</i>

713
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,866
Grandfather...

714
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,663
<i>and I Will finish...</i>

715
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,157
<i>what you started.</i>

716
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,382
A map.

717
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,132
To Skywalker himself?

718
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,968
You are right back
in the mess.

719
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:59,521
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

720
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,348
Hmm...

721
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,474
No.

722
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,855
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

723
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,322
Han.

724
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,527
Go home.

725
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,491
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

726
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,789
Please, we came here for your help.

727
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,033
What fight?

728
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,291
The only fight.

729
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,543
Against the dark side.

730
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,965
Through the ages...

731
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,168
I've seen evil take many forms.

732
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,471
The Sith. The Empire.

733
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:35,891
Today, it is the First Order.

734
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,599
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

735
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,096
We must face them.

736
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,269
Fight them.

737
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,937
All of us.

738
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,152
There is no fight against the First Order.

739
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,353
Not one we can win.

740
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:50,815
Look around.

741
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,275
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

742
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,619
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

743
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:57,904
What's this?

744
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,740
What are you doing?

745
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,955
Solo, what is she doing?

746
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,832
I don't know. But it ain't good.

747
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,797
If you live long enough...

748
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,380
you see the same eyes
in different people.

749
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:19,768
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

750
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,605
You don't know a thing about me.

751
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,936
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

752
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:32,277
You don't know the First Order like I do.

753
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,404
They'll slaughter us.

754
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,611
We all need to run.

755
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:39,784
Hmm.

756
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,078
You see those two?

757
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,414
They'll trade work for transportation...

758
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,961
to the Outer Rim.

759
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,260
There, you can disappear.

760
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,461
Finn?

761
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,881
Come with me.

762
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,972
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

763
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,724
We have to get him back to your base.

764
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,150
I can't.

765
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,160
Keep it, kid.

766
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,834
Who's the girl?

767
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,762
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

768
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,929
What are you doing?

769
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:41,675
Don't leave without me.

770
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,355
You can't just go. I won't let you.

771
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,522
I'm not who you think I am.

772
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,690
Finn, what are you talking about?

773
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,813
I'm not Resistance.

774
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,020
I'm not a hero.

775
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,025
I'm a stormtrooper.

776
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,116
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

777
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,864
And raised to do one thing.

778
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,702
But my first battle, I made a choice.

779
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,712
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

780
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:15,296
So I ran. Right into you.

781
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,970
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

782
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,179
I was ashamed of what I was.

783
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,722
But I'm done with the First Order.

784
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,645
I'm never going back.

785
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,478
Rey, come with me.

786
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:36,814
Don't go.

787
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,737
Take care of yourself.

788
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,203
Please.

789
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,014
No!

790
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,262
<i>No!</i>

791
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,442
<i>No! Come back!</i>

792
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,240
<i>No!</i>

793
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,136
<i>Come back!</i>

794
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,315
No!

795
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,118
No!

796
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,740
Its energy...

797
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,580
<i>- ...surrounds us...
- No!</i>

798
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,045
...and <i>binds</i> us...

799
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,004
The <i>Force will</i> be...

800
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,556
No!

801
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,558
Come back!

802
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,185
<i>UNKAR". Quiet, girl.</i>

803
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,061
No!

804
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,650
<i>Rey?</i>

805
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,957
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

806
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:40,914
What was that?

807
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,884
I shouldn't have gone in there.

808
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,597
That lightsaber was Luke's.

809
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,470
And his father's before him.

810
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:55,221
And now, it calls to you.

811
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,767
I have to get back to Jakku.

812
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,103
Han told me.

813
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,904
Dear child.

814
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,031
I see your eyes.

815
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,114
You already know the truth.

816
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,666
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

817
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,953
they're never coming back.

818
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,126
But...

819
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,633
there's someone who still could.

820
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,933
Luke.

821
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,683
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

822
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,477
it is ahead.

823
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:43,147
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

824
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:47,364
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

825
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,867
Close your eyes.

826
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,153
Feel it.

827
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,540
The light...

828
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:00,035
it's always been there.

829
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,161
It will guide you.

830
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,337
The saber. Take it.

831
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,304
I'm never touching that thing again.

832
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,882
I don't want any part of this.

833
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,344
Hmm.

834
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,870
<i><i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

835
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:51,379
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

836
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,766
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

837
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:01,730
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

838
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:05,441
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

839
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,570
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

840
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:13,150
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

841
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,075
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

842
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,571
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

843
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,498
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

844
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:25,044
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

845
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,622
<i>And will remember this...</i>

846
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:32,799
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

847
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,715
Confirm transfer to manual control.

848
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,345
Configure!

849
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,934
<i>Fire!</i>

850
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,660
CITIZEN; No. What is it?

851
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,843
It was the Republic.

852
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,634
The First Order, they've done it.

853
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,183
Where's Rey?

854
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,699
What are you doing?

855
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,918
You have to go back.

856
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,119
I'm leaving.

857
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,372
BB-8...

858
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,547
No, you can't.

859
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,796
You have to go back,
you're too important.

860
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,047
They'll help you.

861
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,021
I've had this for ages.

862
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,406
Kept it locked away.

863
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,857
Where'd you get that?

864
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,245
A good question. For another time.

865
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,330
Take it.

866
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,907
Find your friend!

867
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,083
Those beasts.

868
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,209
They're here.

869
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,782
<i>FN-417, hold position.</i>

870
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,285
Oh, safety.

871
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,065
STORMTROOPERI Sir.

872
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,484
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

873
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:17,560
<i>With a girl.</i>

874
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,576
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

875
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,495
I'll try to fight them off.

876
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,823
I hope so, too.

877
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,174
Come on, Chewie!

878
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,591
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

879
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,675
Now! Go!

880
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:52,103
I need a weapon!

881
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,646
You have one!

882
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,696
Hey, can I try that?

883
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,666
I like this thing.

884
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:20,919
<i>Traitor!</i>

885
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,511

- Thanks.

01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:08,587
Don't move-.

<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

<i>Head to higher cover and wait

892
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,278
It's the Resistance.

893
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,372
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

894
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,082
<i>- JESS". Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe.</i>

01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,104
Whoo! Yeah!

897
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,610
That's one hell of a pilot!

898
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,021

01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,124
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

907
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,668
<i>We need more troops.</i>

908
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,628
<i>KYLO REN'. Pull the division out.</i>

909
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:31,795
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

910
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:39,928
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

911
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,861
No!

912
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,991
No, no!

913
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,000
No! No!

914
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,003
Rey!

915
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,015
He took her. Did you see that?

916
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,271
He took her. She's gone.

917
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,523
Yeah, I know.

918
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,204
Let's g0.

919
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,379
Goodness! Han Solo!

920
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,677
It is I, C-3PO.

921
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,717
You probably don't recognize me...

922
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,351
because of the red arm.

923
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,391
Look who it is, did you see who...

924
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,181
Uh...

925
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,725
Hmm.

926
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,899
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

927
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,322
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

928
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,071
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

929
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,737
You changed your hair.

930
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,494
Same jacket.

931
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,540
No, new jacket.

932
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,507
I saw him.

933
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,599
Leia, I saw our son.

934
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,560
He was here.

935
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:34,348
CREWMANI Hey!

936
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,813
BB-8, my buddy.

937
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,906
Oh, it's so good to see you.

938
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:43,982
Finn saved you?

939
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,158
Where is he?

940
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,492
Poe?

941
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,029
Oh, n0.

942
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,077
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

943
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,329
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

944
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,752
I got thrown from the crash.

945
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,750
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

946
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,206
BB-8 says that you saved him.

947
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,832
No, no, no. It wasn'tjust me.

948
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,459
You completed my mission, Finn...

949
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,543
That's my jacket.

950
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,087
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

951
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,922
Keep it. It suits you.

952
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,550
You're a good man, Finn.

953
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,435
Poe, I need your help.

954
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,815
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

955
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:20,894
General Organa...

956
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,857
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

957
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,826
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

958
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,699
That was incredibly brave what you did.

959
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,372
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

960
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,366
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

961
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,368
Han told me about the girl.

962
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:37,578
I'm sorry.

963
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,751
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

964
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,831
He worked on the base.

965
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,254
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

966
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,627
That's where my friend was taken.

967
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,007
I've got to get there fast.

968
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,596
And I will do everything I can to help...

969
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,890
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

970
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,603
That sounds very scary.

971
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,850
You must be so brave.

972
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,686
General...

973
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,188
I regret to inform you...

974
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,898
but this map recovered from BB-8...

975
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,483
is only partially complete.

976
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:11,321
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

977
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,531
We simply do not have
enough information...

978
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:15,116
to locate Master Luke.

979
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,202
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

980
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,286
and bring him home.

981
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,537
Leia.

982
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,713
Don't do that.

983
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,005
Do what?

984
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,207
Anything-

985
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:27,503
Princesses.

986
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,175
I'm trying to be helpful.

987
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,431
When did that ever help?

988
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,225
And don't say the Death Star.

989
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,441
C-3POI BB-8.

990
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,615
You're wasting your time.

991
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,446
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

992
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:55,785
the rest of the map in his backup data.

993
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,076
I am afraid not.

994
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,208
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

995
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,044
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

996
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,380
Listen to me, will you?

997
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,725
I know every time you...

998
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,305
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

999
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,390
You think I want to forget him?

1000
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,146
I want him back.

1001
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,361
There's nothing more we could
have done.

1002
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,481
There's too much Vader in him.

1003
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,488
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

1004
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,285
I just never should have sent him away.

1005
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,953
That's when I lost him.

1006
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:38,198
That's when I lost you both.

1007
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,958
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

1008
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,924
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

1009
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:48,716
We both did.

1010
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,671
We lost our son.

1011
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,926
Forever.

1012
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,007
No.

1013
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,679
It was Snoke.

1014
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:59,762
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1015
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,438
But we can still save him.

1016
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:03,265
Me.

1017
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,229
You.

1018
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,403
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1019
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:09,900
Luke is a Jedi.

1020
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:12,824
You're his father.

1021
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:19,327
There is still light in him, I know it.

1022
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,124
General...

1023
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,702
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1024
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,521
Where am I?

1025
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,200
<i>You're my guest.</i>

1026
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,618
Where are the others?

1027
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,366
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

1028
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,324
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

1029
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,751
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

1030
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,839
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

1031
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:11,296
That happens
when you're being hunted...

1032
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,298
by a creature in a mask.

1033
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,078
Tell me about the droid.

1034
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,747
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1035
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:44,166
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1036
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:46,369
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

1037
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,828
And we have the rest.

1038
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,709
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

1039
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:50,880
but we need the last piece.

1040
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:53,425
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

1041
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,044
You.

1042
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:58,756
A scavenger.

1043
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:03,219
You know I can take whatever I want.

1044
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,272
You're so lonely.

1045
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,772
So afraid to leave.

1046
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,866
At night, desperate to sleep.

1047
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,583
You imagine an ocean.

1048
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,831
I see it.

1049
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,830
I see the island.

1050
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,715
And Han Solo.

1051
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,219
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1052
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,343
He would have disappointed you.

1053
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:45,765
Get out of my head.

1054
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,434
I know you've seen the map.

1055
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,187
It's in there.

1056
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,352
And now you'll give it to me.

1057
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:04,033
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1058
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,993
I'm not giving you anything.

1059
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:10,710
We'll see.

1060
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,701
You.

1061
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:53,787
You're afraid.

1062
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,756
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1063
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,770
<i>The scavenger...</i>

1064
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,514
resisted you?

1065
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,190
She is strong with the Force.

1066
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,064
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1067
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:17,359
And the droid?

1068
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:20,780
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1069
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,484
That the girl was all we needed.

1070
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,077
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1071
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:27,278
to the hands of the enemy.

1072
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,122
They may have the map already.

1073
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,824
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

1074
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,951
before they get to Skywalker.

1075
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,911
We have their location.

1076
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,623
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the lleenium system.

1077
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,920
Good.

1078
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,879
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

1079
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,713
Prepare the weapon.

1080
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,137
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1081
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,014
I just need your guidance.

1082
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:55,732
If what you say about this girl is true...

1083
01:29:56,349 --> 01:30:01,025
Bring her to me.

1084
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,166
You will remove these restraints...

1085
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,340
and leave this cell with the door open.

1086
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,837
<i>STORMTROOPER". What did you say?</i>

1087
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,259
You will remove these restraints...

1088
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:33,016
and leave this cell with the door open.

1089
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,398
<i>I'll tighten
those restraints...</i>

1090
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,567
<i>SCHVGHQGF scum.</i>

1091
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,462
You will remove these restraints...

1092
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:01,915
and leave this cell with the door open.

1093
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,220
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

1094
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,047
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

1095
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,022
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And</i> I'll <i>drop my</i> weapon.

1096
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:34,830
No.

1097
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:36,825
No.

1098
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:39,869
Guards!

1099
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:43,415
<i>Guards!</i>

1100
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,673
Begin charging the weapon.

1101
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,098
Yes, sir.

1102
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:53,470
Weapon charging.

1103
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,738
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

1104
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:16,164
confirms Finn's report.

1105
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,249
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1106
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:19,621
built within the planet itself.

1107
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,751
A laser cannon?

1108
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:22,670
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1109
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:23,788
It's another Death Star.

1110
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,624
I wish that were the case, Major.

1111
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,959
This was the Death Star.

1112
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,214
And this is Starkiller Base.

1113
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:33,886
So, it's big.

1114
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:37,060
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1115
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,305
It uses the power of the sun.

1116
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,685
As the weapon is charged...

1117
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,900
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1118
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:44,976
Ma'am.

1119
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:48,025
The First Order...

1120
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:49,568
they're charging the weapon again now.

1121
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,400
Our system is the next target.

1122
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,526
Oh, my.

1123
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,112
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

1124
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:56,993
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1125
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:59,416
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1126
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,164
In order
for that amount of power...

1127
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,619
to be contained...

1128
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:04,670
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1129
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,961
There is one. Precinct 47.

1130
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,792
Here.

1131
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:10,843
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

1132
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,930
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1133
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,803
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1134
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,225
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1135
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:18,685
They have defensive shields...

1136
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,728
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1137
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,267
We disable the shields.

1138
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,020
Kid, you worked there.

1139
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,141
What do you got?

1140
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:26,442
I can do it.

1141
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:27,770
I like this guy.

1142
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:29,771
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1143
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,322
On the planet.

1144
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,024
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1145
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:35,277
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1146
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,278
So we disable the shields...

1147
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:39,660
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1148
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,875
All right. Let's go.

1149
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:05,891
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1150
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,476
Come on. Let's go.

1151
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,778
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1152
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:10,941
Now you tell me?

1153
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:14,282
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

1154
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,036
I've always hated watching you leave.

1155
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:19,328
That's why I did it.

1156
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,074
So you'd miss me.

1157
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:26,624
I did miss you.

1158
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,877
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1159
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:31,048
Huh?

1160
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:34,253
Some of it was... good.

1161
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,092
Pretty good.

1162
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,303
- Some things never change.
- True.

1163
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,846
You still drive me crazy.

1164
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:55,945
If you see our son...

1165
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,116
bring him home.

1166
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:08,207
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar 718.</i>

1167
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,959
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

1168
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,166
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1169
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,963
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

1170
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,715
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1171
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,425
All sentry droids...

1172
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:23,725
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

1173
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,054
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

1174
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,139
<i>Offset 473.</i>

1175
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:31,984
How are we getting in?

1176
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:34,069
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1177
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,818
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

1178
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,323
from getting through.

1179
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,993
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1180
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,536
Chewie, get ready.

1181
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:44,993
And... Now!

1182
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,583
I am pulling up!

1183
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,920
I get any higher...

1184
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,255
they'll see us!

1185
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,571
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

1186
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,788
But all troops are on alert.

1187
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,240
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

1188
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,038
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

1189
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:33,208
Han Solo.

1190
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:46,142
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1191
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,469
We'll get in that way.

1192
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,475
What was your job
when you were based here?

1193
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:50,555
Sanitation.

1194
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,151
Sanitation?

1195
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:56,944
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1196
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,062
I don't.

1197
01:36:58,187 --> 01:36:59,939
I'm just here to get Rey.

1198
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:03,659
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1199
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:05,078
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1200
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,451
We'll use the Force.

1201
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,666
That's not how the Force works.

1202
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,791
Oh, really? You're cold?

1203
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:14,954
Come on.

1204
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,675
Report.

1205
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,974
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1206
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:29,427
Hey!

1207
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,816
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1208
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:37,435
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1209
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,870
- You remember me?
- FN-2187.

1210
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,197
Not anymore.

1211
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:50,707
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1212
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,830
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1213
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:54,911
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1214
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,120
Follow me.

1215
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,768
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-17s?</i>

1216
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:12,516
<i>The T-17s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

1217
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:13,684
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

1218
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:15,648
<i>STORMTROOPER 1". Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

1219
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:16,982
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

1220
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,602
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

1221
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,055
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1222
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,265
Lower the shields.

1223
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,191
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1224
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:01,402
Do it.

1225
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:06,774
Solo, if this works...

1226
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:09,111
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

1227
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:10,570
Don't worry, kid.

1228
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:12,784
We won't leave here without her.

1229
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:17,453
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

1230
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:20,129
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

1231
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,047
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1232
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,212
Is there a garbage chute?

1233
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,219
Trash compactor?

1234
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,470
Yeah, there is.

1235
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,343
General, their shields are down.

1236
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:32,016
Thank the Maker!

1237
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:33,843
Han did it. Send them in.

1238
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:35,849
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1239
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,226
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1240
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:39,307
Roger, base.

1241
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,108
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1242
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,311
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1243
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:58,576
Almost in range.

1244
01:39:58,743 --> 01:40:01,496
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1245
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,456
Approaching target.

1246
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:08,886
Fighters incoming!

1247
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:11,347
OFFICER 2; Coming <i>at 28.336.</i>

1248
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,220
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

1249
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:14,972
Dispatch all squadrons.

1250
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,594
Yes, General.

1251
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:18,429
All right. Let's light it up.

1252
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,283
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1253
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:31,610
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

1254
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:33,073
Another bombing run.

1255
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,913
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1256
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,582
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1257
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:41,831
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1258
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:50,086
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

1259
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,137
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1260
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:01,973
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1261
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,809
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1262
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:05,984
You sure you're up for this?

1263
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,277
Hell, no.

1264
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:08,650
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1265
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:09,946
The troopers will be on our tail.

1266
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:12,150
We have to be ready for that.

1267
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,031
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1268
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,659
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1269
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,080
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1270
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:36,390
You all right?

1271
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:38,092
- Yeah.
- Good.

1272
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:39,768
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1273
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:41,221
Finn, what are you doing here?

1274
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,439
We came back for you.

1275
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:45,854
What'd he say?

1276
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,310
That it was your idea.

1277
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,197
Thank you.

1278
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,661
How did you get away?

1279
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:58,784
I can't explain it.

1280
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,957
And you wouldn't believe it.

1281
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:03,376
Escape now, hug later.

1282
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:20,096
I got one behind me.

1283
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:21,594
<i>- You see it?
- Yeah. I'm on it.</i>

1284
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,070
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1285
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,952
They're in trouble.

1286
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:40,450
We can't leave.

1287
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,243
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1288
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:46,999
Let's use them.

1289
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:48,455
General, are you seeing this?

1290
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:49,922
Two more X-wings down.

1291
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:52,375
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1292
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:55,132
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1293
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,339
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1294
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:24,782
Ah.

1295
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:27,209
Girl knows her stuff.

1296
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,637
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1297
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:41,807
You're right. That's a better idea.

1298
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,884
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1299
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:45,641
Detonator.

1300
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,393
We'll meet back here.

1301
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:33,809
<i>Find them.</i>

1302
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,580
Ben!

1303
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:50,469
Han Solo.

1304
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:54,057
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

1305
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:16,829
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1306
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:19,290
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1307
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:21,668
The face of my son.

1308
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,695
Your son is gone.

1309
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:49,328
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1310
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,238
So I destroyed him.

1311
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:55,702
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1312
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:58,670
But it's not true.

1313
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:02,091
My son is alive.

1314
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:03,634
No.

1315
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:05,928
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1316
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:08,756
Snoke is using you for your power.

1317
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,637
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1318
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:17,561
You know it's true.

1319
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:24,188
It's too late.

1320
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:25,864
No, it's not.

1321
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,692
Leave here with me. Come home.

1322
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:30,865
We miss you.

1323
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:41,706
I'm being torn apart.

1324
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,714
I want to be free of this pain.

1325
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:53,179
I know what I have to do...

1326
01:47:53,258 --> 01:47:55,386
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1327
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,398
Will you help me?

1328
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,317
Yes. Anything.

1329
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:53,451
REYI No!

1330
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:01,619
Thank you.

1331
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:10,127
No.

1332
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:27,045
The oscillator's been damaged...

1333
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,873
but is still functional.

1334
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:31,459
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1335
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,187
The Falcon's this way.

1336
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:06,418
We're not done yet.

1337
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:11,423
You're a monster.

1338
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:13,417
It's just us now.

1339
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:16,087
Han Solo can't save you.

1340
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:26,685
Rey!

1341
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:30,976
<i>REY -</i>

1342
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,060
Rey!

1343
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,523
Oh, no. No, no.

1344
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,607
<i>REY -</i>

1345
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:40,364
Traitor!

1346
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,460
That lightsaber.

1347
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:54,629
It belongs to me.

1348
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,381
Come get it.

1349
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,284
We just lost R-1.

1350
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,199
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1351
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:48,576
What do we do? It isn't working.

1352
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:51,542
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1353
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:54,499
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

1354
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,997
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1355
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,252
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1356
01:53:58,332 --> 01:53:59,879
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1357
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,005
Give it everything you got.

1358
01:54:13,889 --> 01:54:15,266
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1359
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:16,601
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1360
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:19,061
I'm hit!

1361
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:26,489
All teams, I'm going in.

1362
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,782
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

1363
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:29,613
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1364
01:54:35,744 --> 01:54:37,621
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1365
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:40,294
Prepare to fire.

1366
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:14,805
You need a teacher.

1367
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:18,476
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1368
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:22,191
The Force?

1369
01:58:10,959 --> 01:58:12,381
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1370
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,053
We're losing power rapidly!

1371
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,346
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

1372
01:58:18,425 --> 01:58:21,725
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1373
01:58:21,845 --> 01:58:23,347
Supreme Leader.

1374
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:26,190
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1375
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:28,394
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1376
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:32,652
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1377
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:35,609
It is time...

1378
01:58:35,692 --> 01:58:38,036
to complete his training.

1379
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,364
Finn!

1380
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:43,332
Finn.

1381
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:35,552
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1382
01:59:58,483 --> 02:00:01,612
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1383
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:19,137
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1384
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:20,471
We've got a heartbeat.

1385
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,152
C-3POI R2-D2!

1386
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:26,029
You've come back.

1387
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:31,413
You found what?

1388
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:33,536
How dare you call me that!

1389
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:38,008
Find Master Luke, how?

1390
02:01:38,082 --> 02:01:39,129
Come, R2.

1391
02:01:39,209 --> 02:01:41,211
We must go tell the others at once!

1392
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:43,637
General.

1393
02:01:43,713 --> 02:01:45,886
Excuse me, General.

1394
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:52,973
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

1395
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:55,108
Tell me.

1396
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:06,907
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1397
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:22,961
The map, it is complete.

1398
02:02:23,586 --> 02:02:25,259
Luke.

1399
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:26,931
Oh, my dear friend...

1400
02:02:27,048 --> 02:02:28,595
how I've missed you.

1401
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:47,615
We'll see each other again.

1402
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:49,617
I believe that.

1403
02:02:57,787 --> 02:02:59,585
Thank you, my friend.

1404
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:16,313
Rey.

1405
02:03:17,974 --> 02:03:20,773
May the Force be with you.
